0,"Four important implications for policy to promote and guide a transformation toward healthy diets for all Kenyans can be drawn from this research: First, Kenya’s diet problem — the underconsumption of nutritious foods and increasingly high consumption of calorie-rich but micronutrient-sparse foods — is primarily a poverty problem. Most Kenyans simply cannot afford a healthy diet. Accelerated poverty reduction will have important nutritional benefits. Second, there are large differences between the costs of meeting dietary guidelines for highly nutritious foods and the costs of obtaining adequate amounts of calorie-dense staple foods. These cost gaps have a strong effect on household diets because the food choices of many Kenyan households are primarily driven by a need to satisfy calorie requirements. This points to a problem of relative food prices, which interacts with the poverty problem. It is most apparent for animal-source protein foods and, to a lesser degree, for vegetables. Thus, policy interventions and technological innovations that address this relative food price problem are needed to narrow the consumption gaps for nutritious food groups, particularly animal-source foods and vegetables. Third, the food preferences of Kenyans show that the poor-quality diets consumed by many households are not solely due to insufficient purchasing power and high prices for nutritious foods. This is most obvious for plant-based protein foods — pulses and nuts — which have low prices per calorie, but which few households consume in sufficient amounts to meet the recommended healthy intake. This weak consumer preference for such foods suggests a lack of knowledge of their nutritional value and their importance for healthy diets. Nutrition education may aid in changing consumer behavior to increase the consumption of pulses and nuts, as well as other nutritious foods that are now underconsumed relative to the healthy reference diet. Kenyans can consume more healthy diets with their current incomes. While healthy diets are costly for many Kenyan households, changes can be made in the current typical diet to achieve better and more balanced nutrient intake at the same cost. Finally, policies aimed at promoting food systems transformation in Kenya should factor in the dietary needs of Kenyans. As agriculture is the dominant sector in Kenya’s food systems, a balance must be found between traditional objectives including productivity growth, export stimulation, and farmer support, on the one hand, and the new responsibility of improving the availability of nutrient-dense foods for better nutrition and health for all Kenyans, on the other.",Open Access,,"Ecker, Olivier

1,"The policy brief provides an overview of the updated Kenya Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs). The current Kenya SAM which incorporates latest rebased national accounts data, supply and use tables and household budget survey, is an update of the previous SAM compiled for 2009 transactions. SAMs are used in conjunction with analytical techniques to strengthen the evidence underlying policies. The updated Kenya SAM 2021 identifies 90 production activities and commodities (products) across agriculture, industry, and services sectors. As an economy-wide data framework, SAM best captures priority production sectors outlined in the government’s new development plan (Bottom-up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA)). For instance, priority sub-sectors highlighted in the plan include maize, dairy, cattle, tea value addition, expanding and revamping export cash crops such as coffee, cashew nuts, avocado, macadamia nuts and pyrethrum, revamping leather, cotton, pharmaceutical, and textile and clothing industries. Using this SAM data framework, analysis can be done to assess the likely impacts of implementing BETA on jobs, poverty and food security in Kenya. The SAM also in cludes 3 broad categories of production factors (land, capital and labour), and 15 household groups by quintiles. Highlight from Kenya SAM 2021 suggests that services sector contributed the largest share to GDP (57.8%), followed by Agriculture (23.4%), and Industry (18.7%). The brief also presents the share of ex ternal trade to total output and domestic demand, showing that Kenya exports more agriculture-related products while it imports more industrial products. In 2021, Kenya exported 7.1 per cent of its output while import share to domestic demand was 11 per cent, and in the agriculture sector, export to output share was 16.3 per cent. The Kenya SAM 2021 provides policymakers with the necessary data and analytical tools to design and implement effective policies to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty and inequality.",Open Access,https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/XLKGGA,"Breisinger, Clemens

2,"Tanzania experienced strong annual economic growth of 6.2 percent between 2009 and 2019 (NBS 2020). Despite the country’s relatively less restrictive domestic COVID-19 measures, the adverse effects of the global commodity market disruptions during the pandemic led to a slowdown in GDP growth to 4.8 percent in 2020 and 4.9 percent in 2021 (NBS 2021). Growth is expected to reach 5.3 percent in 2023 and 6.1 percent in 2024 (World Bank 2023), suggesting that Tanzania is returning to its pre-pandemic growth trajectory. While the economy has been going through a process of structural transformation with rapid growth, agriculture continues to play an important role in both output and employment, accounting for about 30 percent of total GDP and 70 percent of employment in 2019. The agriculture sector performed well over the pre-pandemic decade, with agricultural growth accelerating from 3.8 percent per year in the 2009–2014 period to 5 percent in the 2014–2019 period (NBS 2020). The agriculture sector has also been playing an important role in weathering the global commodity market shocks in 2022 and 2023, thanks to some export crops that benefit from the negative terms of trade shock (Diao and Thurlow 2023). In this brief, we unpack the historical and projected economic growth trajectory further to better understand the role of agriculture as well as the broader agrifood system (AFS) in the performance and transformation of the economy of Tanzania.",Open Access,,"Benfica, Rui

3,"Ghana experienced rapid economic growth with an annual GDP growth rate of 6.6 percent between 2009 and 2019 (GSS 2023). Restrictive COVID-19 policy measures in 2020 caused a slowdown in growth (Amewu et al. 2020), with the rate falling to just 0.5 percent in that year (World Bank 2023a). Economic growth rebounded to 5.4 percent in 2021, but this growth was fueled by excessive government borrowing to finance an ambitious public infrastructure campaign and ushered in a severe financial crisis in Ghana. By 2022, the fiscal deficit had reached almost 10 percent of GDP and the total debt-to-GDP ratio had skyrocketed to 90 percent, resulting in rampant inflation (32 percent year-on year), a doubling of interest rates (from 14 to 28 percent), and a sharp currency depreciation (40 percent) (World Bank 2023b; Naadi 2023). Economic growth slowed to 3.2 percent in 2022 and is projected to decline further to 1.6 percent in 2023 (World Bank 2023a). Although President Akuffo-Addo blamed “malevolent forces” (Financial Times 2023)—including the global commodity market shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which by some accounts had only a minimal effect on Ghana’s economy (Arndt et al. 2023; Diao and Thurlow 2023)—the economic situation eventually forced the government to agree to an IMF bailout of US$3 billion in 2023.

4,"Senegal experienced annual economic growth of 4.8 percent during the 2009 to 2019 period (World Bank 2023a). With an annual population growth rate of 2.7 percent over the same period, the living standards of Senegalese improved modestly. In 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant slowdown in economic growth, but growth rebounded in 2021. While the country was adversely affected by the global commodity market disruptions related to the Russia-Ukraine war that started in 2022 (Arndt et al. 2023; Diao and Thurlow 2023), its growth is projected to reach 8.0 percent in 2023 and 10.5 percent in 2024 (World Bank 2023b). This suggests a much-improved short-term outlook and a future growth trajectory well above its pre-pandemic growth trajectory. Agriculture is a relatively small sector in Senegal, accounting for less than one-fifth of GDP. However, the broader agrifood system (AFS), which includes processing, trade and transport of agrifood products, and food services, makes up about one-third of GDP. In this brief, we examine the performance of Senegal’s broader AFS and its

6,"Bangladesh experienced strong annual economic growth of 6.6 percent between 2009 and 2019 (BBS 2021). While the global COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant growth slowdown in 2020, growth started to recover in 2021. However, the recovery was hampered by global commodity market disruptions related to the war in Ukraine beginning in 2022 and the global recession in 2023 (Arndt et al. 2023; Diao and Thurlow 2023). The World Bank (2023) projects growth of 5.2 percent for 2023 and 6.2 percent for 2024, which is slower than the country’s pre-pandemic growth rate. Rapid growth in the past has already led to significant structural shifts in Bangladesh’s economy along with a transformation within the agrifood system (AFS). In this brief, we unpack these trends and future projections further to understand how Bangladesh’s AFS is contributing to growth and transformation in the country.",Open Access,,"Diao, Xinshen

7,"Rwanda has made remarkable economic progress during the past two decades, and its annual GDP growth rate reached more than 7 percent during the 2009 to 2019 period (NISR 2021). The rapid economic growth has been pro-poor, and the poverty rate fell from 58.9 percent in 2000/01 to 38.2 percent in 2016/17 (NISR 2018). The country has also emerged as a leader among sub-Saharan African countries in promoting innovation, gender equality, and an enabling business environment for development. The government remains strongly committed to a set of ambitious development goals, as set forth in the 2017–2024 National Strategy for Transformation (NST 1) and the corresponding sector-level strategic plans. While the global COVID-19 pandemic had a severe adverse effect on the economy, causing negative GDP growth in 2020, the country rebounded quickly and registered more than 10 percent growth in 2021 (NISR 2022). The country was only minimally affected by global commodity market disruptions resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war that started in 2022 and the global recession in 2023 (Arndt et al. 2023; Diao and Thurlow 2023). Looking forward, Rwanda’s GDP growth is projected to reach 6.7 percent in 2023 and 7.0 percent in 2024 (World Bank 2023), suggesting the economy is returning to its pre-pandemic high-growth trajectory.",Open Access,,"Diao, Xinshen

8,"Myanmar initiated economic and political reforms in 2011, ushering in a period of rapid economic transformation. The country experienced strong annual average economic growth of close to 7 percent between 2011 and 2019. The rural economy and the agriculture sector were also transforming, characterized by accelerated rural out-migration from the sector, which was facilitated by favorable policy changes, increased trade, and improved road infrastructure (Filipski et. al. 2021). Rural wages rose (Belton et. al. 2021), and labor shortages, along with increased access to financing, led to a massive expansion of mechanization services (Win et al. 2018) and other rural nonfarm enterprises. However, the economic transformation was disrupted by the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the political crisis caused by the military coup d’état in 2021. During this recent period, Myanmar’s agrifood system was impacted by numerous shocks, including disruptions to the banking and local transportation systems, changes to international trade policies, rapidly depreciating currency, foreign exchange controls, increasing global commodity prices, and massive declines in income and access to credit, among others. In this brief, we focus on Myanmar’s agrifood system between 2011 and 2019 and evaluate the potential contributions of different value chains to driving agricultural transformation and welfare gains in the future.",Open Access,,"Diao, Xinshen

9,"Uganda experienced annual economic growth of 5.8 percent between 2009 and 2019 (UBOS 2020). While restrictive COVID-19 policy measures in 2020 and 2021 caused a slowdown in the economy, the country has largely been spared the adverse effects of the global commodity market disruptions arising from the Russia-Ukraine war that started in 2022 and from the 2023 global recession (Arndt et al. 2023; Diao and Thurlow 2023). Uganda’s GDP growth is projected to reach 5.5 percent in 2023 and 6.1 percent in 2024 (World Bank 2023), suggesting that the economy is resuming its pre-pandemic growth trajectory. Agriculture remains an important sector, accounting for one-quarter of GDP and two-thirds of Uganda’s jobs. The agriculture sector also performed well in the 2009 to 2019 period, growing at 5.0 percent annually (UBOS 2020). Thanks to a positive terms of trade shock and an established trade surplus in agrifood products, this sector played an important role in weathering the 2022 and 2023 global commodity market shocks (Diao and Thurlow 2023). In this brief, we examine Uganda’s economic growth and transformation trajectory, both historically and going forward. Rather than focusing on the role of primary agriculture, we examine how the country’s broader agrifood system (AFS) is contributing to that transformation process.",Open Access,,"Diao, Xinshen

10,"Bangladesh experienced strong annual economic growth of 6.6 percent between 2009 and 2019 (BBS 2021). While the global COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant growth slowdown in 2020, growth started to recover in 2021. However, the recovery was hampered by global commodity market disruptions related to the war in Ukraine beginning in 2022 and the global recession in 2023 (Arndt et al. 2023; Diao and Thurlow 2023). The World Bank (2023) projects growth of 5.2 percent for 2023 and 6.2 percent for 2024, which is slower than the country’s pre-pandemic growth rate. Rapid growth in the past has already led to significant structural shifts in Bangladesh’s economy along with a transformation within the agrifood system (AFS). In this brief, we unpack these trends and future projections further to understand how Bangladesh’s AFS is contributing to growth and transformation in the country.",Open Access,,"Diao, Xinshen

11,"Agriculture in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is dominated by subsistence farming. Households grow food mainly for their own consumption and sell only when they have a surplus. The main crops are cassava, maize, yams, plantains, and rice (FAO 2019). Commercial farming of cash crops such as coffee, palm oil, rubber, and sugar is done on a smaller scale. With constant political instability, infrastructure deficiencies, and lack of investment in DRC, the expansion and productivity of commercial farming have been constrained (World Bank 2020). Livestock and fisheries are also important agrifood subsectors and face constraints similar to the crop subsectors. Despite these challenges, DRC possesses robust agricultural potential due to its vast arable land resources, abundant water resources, and its diverse climatic conditions, which are suitable for a wide variety of crops. There is also potential for further development of the fisheries sector due to the country’s extensive river system and large lakes. In this brief, we look beyond primary agriculture to understand the recent performance of DRC’s broader agrifood system (AFS) and how it is contributing to growth and transformation in the country.",Open Access,,"Diao, Xinshen

12,"Zambia experienced modest economic growth of 4.8 percent per year between 2010 and 2019 (ZamStats 2020). Most growth occurred in the earlier part of the decade. After world commodity prices fell in 2014, the GDP growth rate slowed to an annual rate of 3.1 percent (for 2014–2019), which is below the country’s population growth rate. The global COVID-19 pandemic further damaged the economy and GDP declined by 2.8 percent in 2020. The global commodity market disruptions related to the Russia Ukraine war that started in 2022 and the global recession in 2023 are expected to further harm Zambia’s economy (Arndt et al. 2023; Diao and Thurlow 2023). Zambia’s projected GDP growth rate is 3.9 percent for 2023 and 4.1 percent for 2024 (World Bank 2023). Its economy relies heavily on exports of copper and other minerals. While mining is a large sector in total GDP, it creates few jobs in the country. Agriculture remains important in employment, accounting for near 40 percent of jobs.

13,"Niger is a landlocked country in West Africa, and most of the population relies on subsistence farming. The country faces considerable food security challenges due to a combination of recurring droughts, desertification, population growth, and political instability. The World Food Program estimates that around 1.5 million people in Niger—roughly 6 percent of the population—are food insecure (WFP 2020). Agriculture plays a pivotal role in Niger’s economy, employing more than 80 percent of workers and contributing around 40 percent of GDP. The agricultural system is largely rainfed and productive activities are concentrated in the southern part of the country, particularly in the regions along the Niger River. Only 15 percent of the country’s land is arable, and rainfall is seasonal and highly variable. Millet, sorghum, cowpeas, and groundnuts are the major food crops, while pastoralism is a key component of the agricultural system, particularly in the arid regions in the north of the country. Despite the dominance of agriculture, Niger is a net food importer as agricultural production falls short of domestic food needs (FAO 2018). The government implemented the 3N Initiative (Nigeriens Nourishing Nigeriens) to address the root causes of food insecurity. This initiative aims to promote sustainable agricultural practices, enhance the resilience of farmers to climate change, and improve access to food (IFAD 2020). While rural households produce a significant amount of their own food, the importance of market purchases as a determinant of food security cannot be overstated. Market purchases are the primary food access strategy for Nigeriens for 8–9 months of the year. This highlights the importance not only of primary agricultural production, but also the broader agrifood system (AFS) in ensuring year-round access and availability of nutritious foods. Hence, in this brief we look beyond primary agriculture to understand the performance of Niger’s broader AFS and how it is contributing to growth and transformation in the country.",Open Access,,"Diao, Xinshen

14,"Nepal experienced annual economic growth of 5.0 percent between 2009 and 2019 (World Bank 2023b). Thanks to a relatively slow population growth rate of 1.4 percent, the living standards of most Nepalis improved during this period; this allowed Nepal to graduate in 2019 from a low-income country to a lower-middle-income country. Nepal’s economy, however, was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with GDP declining by 2.4 percent in 2020 and growing only modestly in 2021. Fortunately, the country was largely spared the adverse effects of global commodity market disruptions arising from the Russia-Ukraine war that started in 2022 and from the 2023 global recession (Arndt et al. 2023; Diao and Thurlow 2023). Nepal’s GDP growth is now projected to reach 5.1 percent in 2023 and 4.9 percent in 2024 (World Bank 2023a); this suggests that the economy is resuming its pre-pandemic growth trajectory. Agriculture remains an important sector, accounting for 25 percent of Nepal’s GDP and 30 percent of its jobs. In this brief, we further unpack Nepal’s historical and projected economic growth trajectory in order to better understand the role of agriculture, and of the broader agrifood system (AFS), in the performance and transformation of its economy.",Open Access,,"Xinshen Diao

15,"Madagascar’s economy showed little progress during the decade from 2009 to 2019, growing at an average rate of just 2.9 percent per year, which is only marginally higher than the population growth rate of 2.7 percent (World Bank 2023). The global COVID-19 pandemic pushed the economy into negative growth in 2020, while drought, flooding, and storm damages in 2021 and 2022 had further adverse impacts on the economy. Current projections suggest the economy will achieve growth of 4.2 percent in 2023 and 4.6 percent in 2024, which are well above pre-pandemic growth rates (World Bank 2023). Agriculture is a relatively important sector in Madagascar, accounting for nearly 30 percent of GDP and more than 60 percent of employment. The poor performance of the agriculture sector in the 2009 to 2019 period—the sector grew at only 0.5 percent per year—was an important reason for weak growth overall (INSTAT 2020). In this brief, we unpack the historical and projected economic growth trajectory further to better understand the role of agriculture as well as the broader agrifood system (AFS) in the performance and transformation of the economy of Madagascar.",Open Access,,"Pauw, Karl

18,"Ethiopia stands out as one of the fastest growing African countries between 2009 and 2019, with an average annual GDP growth rate close to 10 percent (ESS 2020). The global COVID-19 pandemic coupled with an armed civil conflict that started in November 2020 and continued for two years caused a significant slowdown in economic growth during the 2020–2022 period. Ethiopia’s GDP growth is now projected to recover to 5.3 percent in 2023 and 6.1 percent in 2024 (World Bank 2023), remaining well below the growth rates achieved in the pre-pandemic era. Agriculture remains an important sector in Ethiopia, accounting for one-third of GDP and two-thirds of jobs. The agriculture sector, like the broader economy, performed well prior to the pandemic and civil conflict, averaging 5.5 percent growth from 2009 to 2019 (ESS 2020), and played an important role in weathering the global commodity market shocks during 2022–2023 (Diao and Thurlow 2023).

19,"Malawi experienced modest growth from 2009 to 2019, with average annual GDP growth of 4.7 percent. The global COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant slowdown in 2020 and 2021, and the economy has not yet rebounded to pre-pandemic levels (World Bank 2023). At the time of writing, GDP is projected to grow at 2.4 percent in 2023, which in combination with population growth of 2.7 percent would result in a 0.3 percent contraction of GDP per capita (IMF 2023). At the core of the failure to resume pre-pandemic economic growth rates are a worsening debt crisis, a balance of payment crisis, an acute shortage of foreign exchange reserves, and several external shocks (World Bank 2022). The latter include the effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the devastation caused by cyclone Freddy in 2023 (De Weerdt and Duchoslav 2022; Diao et al. 2022).",Open Access,,"Diao, Xinshen

20,"Ethiopia stands out as one of the fastest growing African countries between 2009 and 2019, with an average annual GDP growth rate close to 10 percent (ESS 2020). The global COVID-19 pandemic coupled with an armed civil conflict that started in November 2020 and continued for two years caused a significant slowdown in economic growth during the 2020–2022 period. Ethiopia’s GDP growth is now projected to recover to 5.3 percent in 2023 and 6.1 percent in 2024 (World Bank 2023), remaining well below the growth rates achieved in the pre-pandemic era. Agriculture remains an important sector in Ethiopia, accounting for one-third of GDP and two-thirds of jobs. The agriculture sector, like the broader economy, performed well prior to the pandemic and civil conflict, averaging 5.5 percent growth from 2009 to 2019 (ESS 2020), and played an important role in weathering the global commodity market shocks during 2022–2023 (Diao and Thurlow 2023).

21,"Kenya experienced significant economic development in the 2009 to 2019 period. Gross domestic product (GDP)—an indicator of the economy’s size—expanded by an annual average of 5 percent (KNBS 2022). This exceeded population growth and helped raise household incomes, leading to a decline in poverty rates; more importantly, for the first time in at least three decades, the country experienced a decline in the absolute number of poor people (World Bank 2022). While the global COVID-19 pandemic caused negative economic growth in 2020, the economy recovered quickly in 2021. Kenya was also largely spared the adverse effects of the global commodity market disruptions arising from the Russia-Ukraine war that started in 2022 and from the global recession in 2023 (Arndt et al. 2023; Diao and Thurlow 2023). Kenya’s GDP growth is projected to reach 5.0 percent in 2023 and 5.3 percent in 2024 (World Bank 2023), suggesting that the economy is resuming its pre-pandemic growth trajectory. Agriculture remains an important sector, accounting for about one-quarter of GDP and nearly half of Kenya’s employment. It has thus played an important role in economic development. The sector has grown alongside the rest of the economy despite many challenges including climate variability (Ochieng et al. 2020), weak rural infrastructure (Benin and Odjo 2018), declines in farm size (Jayne et al. 2016), and limited access to farm inputs combined with poor agronomic management (Worku et al. 2020).

30,"The prices of staple grains began rising in mid-2020, reflecting higher fertilizer prices and the supply chain bottlenecks caused by the outbreak of Covid-19, and increased sharply following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. How have these dramatic increases in world prices of cereals affected poverty in low-income countries? This brief estimates the impact of higher world grain prices on poverty in Niger. Other briefs in this series examine the impact of higher food prices on poverty in Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Mali (see Minot and Martin, 2023a and 2023b; Martin and Minot, 2023a, 2023b, and 2023c). 
All six studies use a similar approach. First, we examine the effect of the rise in international cereal prices on the real price of key grains in the domestic markets of the country. Second, we estimate the impact of the changes in domestic grain prices on the real income of each household using nationally-representative survey data, taking into account the importance of the commodities in consumption and as a source of income for each household. Finally, we estimate the changes in headcount poverty (the share of people living below the poverty line) based on the changes in real income for each household in the sample. We focus on the prices of maize, wheat, and sorghum for reasons discussed below.",Open Access,,"Minot, Nicholas

After a long period of relatively stable prices on world mar kets, the prices of key food staples began to rise during 2020.

32,"Since its launch in 2012, the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) has been widely used in USAID projects to prioritize and target activities that aim to promote women’s empowerment. It has been implemented in at least 37 countries by more than 200 partners and 60 different USAID operating units, offering valuable insights into the gender dynamics of agricultural production and identifying opportunities to enhance gender equality and women’s empowerment. By providing a more nuanced understanding of the challenges that women encounter in the agricultural sector, WEAI has played a crucial role in enhancing the ability of USAID programming to improve the lives of women and their families.
This report presents key findings gathered from all reported WEAI use cases in the Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC), the largest resource for USAID-funded technical and project materials. A use case refers to a unique, real-world ex ample in which WEAI has been applied or utilized. A use case can demonstrate how WEAI has been used in a specific context or project, providing insight into its effectiveness, limitations, and potential for future applications. Together, these findings highlight the importance of WEAI as a tool for promoting gender equality and empowering women in the agricultural sector, while also providing useful insights that can inform future policies and programs.",Open Access,,"Moore, Lindsey

34,"In flood-prone communities in Northeast Nigeria, we used a randomized evaluation to measure the impacts of providing cash transfers to households before the onset of a shock (“anticipatory cash”) compared to the standard practice of providing cash transfers after a shock occurs.
Results indicate that providing anticipatory cash to households in flood-prone areas reduced negative coping strategies, increased pre-emptive climate adaptive actions, and enhanced investment in productive assets compared to households that received cash after peak flooding occurred.
The findings suggest that large, one-time anticipatory cash transfers can build households’ climate adaptive and resilience capacity, making them a promising intervention to reduce household vulnerability to future climate shocks.",Open Access,,"Burke, Laura",,137068.pdf,136857,"Balana, Bedru; Clingain, Clare",,https://doi.org/10.2499/p15738coll2.136857,10.2499/p15738coll2.136857,2023-09-05,2023-09-06,2023-09-19,Publication available at https://www.rescue.org/report/acting-disaster-strikes-impacts-anticipatory-cash-transfers-climate-resilience-northeast,"Burke, Laura. 2023.

The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 caused an additional spike in commodity prices, particularly wheat and maize. This brief estimates the impact of these price increases on poverty in Burkina Faso. It is part of a series of six such briefs that estimate the poverty impact of higher world prices for staple grains. The other briefs cover Kenya, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria, and Mali (see Minot and Martin, 2023a and 2023b; Martin and Minot, 2023a, 2023b, and 2023c). 
We use the same approach in all six country studies. The analysis starts by exploring the effect of the rise in international grain prices on the real price of selected grains in the domestic markets of the country. Next, we estimate the impact of the changes in domestic grain prices on the real income of each household in a nationally representative survey, taking into account the importance of the commodities in consumption and as a source of income for each household. Finally, changes in headcount poverty (the share of people living below the poverty line) are estimated based on the changes in real income for each household in the sample. We focus on the prices of maize, wheat, and sorghum for reasons discussed below. The methods are described in more detail in a method brief.",Open Access,,"Minot, Nicholas

36,"Kenya is potentially very vulnerable to sharp increases in the prices of key staple grains such as maize and wheat, both because these are important in diets and because Kenya depends on im ports of these products. A first step in understanding the impacts of changes in the prices of these products is to examine developments in their prices on world markets. After a long period of rela tively stable prices on world markets, the prices of key food staples began to rise from around the beginning of 2020. This period of price increases, spanning the COVID-19 pandemic and then the price shocks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine raised serious concerns about the welfare of poor people in countries such as Kenya. Figure 1 shows the movements in the prices of four key grain staples—maize, rice, sorghum and wheat—from the beginning of 2020.",Open Access,,"Minot, Nicholas

40,"About 1.5 billion people, most of the world’s poor, live on small farms in developing countries. Improving livelihoods requires investing in their “agriculture human capital”: skills, abilities and knowledge, social and personal attributes and experience to enable them to farm productively and sustainably. These include technical agricultural skills in crops and livestock, business skills in marketing, records, as well as functional skills such as empowerment, leadership, and innovation. There is high demand for human capital development but public agencies often cannot provide it and smallholders cannot afford to pay for it. There is great need for it as agriculture becomes more commercial, information- and skill-intensive and climate change increases weather hazards.
This brief aims to assess the private sector’s role in developing smallholder human capital, and the advantages, limitations and challenges of this involvement. It outlines how development agencies and governments can facilitate the private sector to increase investment. The brief concludes with recommendations on how development agencies and governments can support and facilitate private sector investment.
The main providers of non-formal agricultural train ing are extension and advisory services (EAS), mainly government, private companies, NGOs and farmer organizations. Other providers include agricultural technical and vocational education and training centres, on-the-job training such as internships, and informal interaction between farmers.",Open Access,,"Franzel, Steven","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",136840.pdf,136631,"Davis, Kristin; Gammelgaard, Johanna; Preissing, John",https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/igo/,https://doi.org/10.4060/cc4370en,10.4060/cc4370en,2023-03-28,2023-03-29,2023-04-19,,"Franzel, Steven. 2023.

41,"Empowering women is crucial for a country's development because it leads to greater economic growth, increased productivity, and improved social outcomes. When women have access to education, economic opportunities, and decision-making power, they are better able to contribute to their families and communities. This can lead to increased income, improved health and education outcomes, and reduced poverty.   In Bangladesh, women and girls still face considerable barriers to accessing education and economic opportunities, and are often subjected to traditional gender roles that may hinder them. Although women play a crucial role in agriculture, they experience many challenges that limit their productivity and economic potential, such as limited access to credit and training. They are also often marginalized and excluded from decision-making processes.  As the complexity and importance of gender equity in development work has increased, so too has the need to measure empowerment and progress made toward improving empowerment and achieving gender parity. In Bangladesh, there has been growing momentum by the government and development partners to use evidence to inform gender-sensitive and -responsive policies and programs. The Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) has emerged as a key tool to achieve this objective.   This brief examines how WEAI data have informed and supported the design of policies and programs to promote women's empowerment in Bangladesh.",Open Access,,"Ahmed, Akhter

47,"Women migrant domestic workers (WMDWs) constitute 7.7 percent of migrant workers worldwide, of whom more than a quarter live and work in the Arab region. In Lebanon, as in other Arab countries, WMDWs are recruited through the sponsorship system, Kafala. Under this system, a potential migrant worker can only obtain legal residency and a work permit in the country of destination if she is sponsored by a specific employer. Once in the destination country, the worker cannot transfer to a new employer unless granted permission by the original sponsor. The system heightens the social, economic, and legal vulnerability of WMDWs and has been described as unfree or bound labor and a system of racialized servitude. Yet, Kafala is not a written policy but rather a collection of administrative procedures, customary practices, and socially acceptable norms that are maintained by various players throughout the migration process. The question then arises as to whether advocacy efforts that focus on abolishing Kafala as a legal term would mitigate employers’ exploitative practices that violate the workers’ rights and freedoms, particularly in a country like Lebanon.

This policy brief is based on a study carried out under the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Work in Freedom project designed to mitigate the exploitation and forced labor of women migrating from South to West Asia to work in the domestic and garment sectors. This brief explores knowledge, awareness and attitudes to Kafala by employers in Lebanon.",Open Access,,"Abdulrahim, Sawsan

63,"Egypt’s national cash transfer program, Takaful, and its sister program Karama covered 17 million poor beneficiaries as of 2022, about 16 percent of the Egyptian population. Takaful was designed in 2015 as a conditional cash transfer program providing income support targeted to the most vulnerable, namely poor families with children under age 18. As one of the largest programs — both in absolute terms and in terms of share of the population covered — in the wave of national cash transfer programs spreading across Africa, as well as an innovator among countries in the Middle East, Egypt’s experience has the potential to serve as a model for these regions. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), in collaboration with the Ministry of Social Solidarity, conducted a first-round evaluation of the program in 2017 to estimate its effects on household well-being (Breisinger et al. 2018). That evaluation found large positive impacts on several outcomes, most notably, household consumption. The second-round evaluation, conducted in 2022, found a shift toward greater investment in physical and human capital among program beneficiaries. This brief summarizes the main findings from that second-round evaluation, noting differences from the first evaluation results and providing key recommendations.",Open Access,,"El-Enbaby, Hoda

64,"The World Food Programme (WFP) supports communities to mitigate the impact of and build resilience to natural and human-made shocks and stressors that contribute to food insecurity and destabilize people’s livelihoods. WFP’s interventions, therefore, aim to equip communities with the knowledge, skills, and tools to avert or mitigate the impact of cyclical natural events such as droughts and floods through asset and capacity building in affected communities. In the Sahelian areas of Burkina Faso and Niger (as part of a broader regional program also covering Chad, Mali, and Mauritania), WFP promotes climate-resilient agricultural infrastructure and systems to help address issues of land degradation, deforestation, dwindling pasturelands, and depletion of water sources, which all trigger competition for productive resources and migration of people and livestock into better-resourced areas. The interventions also aim to address the impacts of violent conflict from within and outside communities in the Sahelian belt of the two countries, especially those related to extremist groups operating in the area. 
Though primarily designed to increase community assets for productive purposes, WFP’s support for the rehabilitation of lands, construction of water-harvesting and retention structures, reforestation and protection of farmlands and pastures, and soil fertility improvement interventions also aims to increase the availability of, reduce intergroup competition for, and ensure equitable access to these resources. In this way, WFP hopes to reduce conflicts over community resources. The use of participatory and collaborative processes for mobilizing and engaging communities should also contribute to increased dialogue within and between different communities and promote peaceful coexistence among the different groups. In particular, the requirement of collaborative approaches to development of communal assets is intended to create spaces of encounter and dialogue that could ease tensions, promote equity in the distribution and use of the created assets, and build relationships among various stakeholders and community groups to ensure that actions for resilience building have the support of government, development partners, and other decision-makers at several administrative levels.",Open Access,,"Pul, Hippolyt

Other factors, such as export bans, have also contributed to rising prices. Palm oil and wheat prices increased by 56 and 100 percent in real terms, respectively, between June 2021 and April 2022, with most of the in-crease occurring since February (Figure 1). Wide variation exists across products, with real maize prices increasing by only 11 percent and rice prices declining by 13 percent.

71,"Global food, fuel, and fertilizer prices have risen rapidly in recent months, driven in large part by the fallout from the ongoing war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia. Other factors, such as export bans, have also contributed to rising prices. Palm oil and wheat prices increased by 56 and 100 percent in real terms, respectively, between June 2021 and April 2022, with most of the in-crease occurring since February (Figure 1). Wide variation exists across products, with real maize prices increasing by only 11 percent and rice prices declining by 13 percent. The price of crude oil and natural gas has also risen substantially, while the weighted average price of fertilizer has dou-bled. With these changes in global prices, many developing countries and their development part-ners are concerned about the implications for economic stability, food security, and poverty.",Open Access,,"Diao, Xinshen

85,"By mid-2022, the magnitude and severity of acute food insecurity in countries with available data reached alarming levels, but data gaps continued to obscure the full picture. In 2021, the population in the three highest phases of acute food insecurity was the largest in the six-year history of the GRFC. By September 2022, these numbers increased again to 201.4– 205.1 million people, making 2022 the fourth consecutive year of rising levels of acute hunger. The number of acutely food-insecure people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) or equivalent is actually higher than this estimate, but data gaps continue to limit reporting of timely, comparable and consensual data. Data was missing for 2022 in eight countries/territories, including Bangladesh (Cox’s Bazar), Palestine and the Syrian Arab Republic.

86,"Global food, fuel, and fertilizer prices have risen rapidly in recent months, driven in large part by the fallout from the ongoing war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia. Other factors, such as export bans in response to concerns about commodity shortages, have also contributed to rising prices. Figure 1 examines price changes in key food and nonfood commodities between June 2021 and June 2022. The period of interest for this study is June 2021 to April 2022. Over this period, palm oil and wheat prices increased by 68 and 113 percent in nominal terms, respectively. When deflated by the US Consumer Price Index, these price changes equate to 56 and 100 percent in real terms. Wide variation exists across food products, with nominal maize prices increasing by 19 per-cent (or 11 percent in real terms), and rice prices declining by 13 percent (or 7 percent in real terms) over the same period. Prices of nonfood commodities also rose substantially. Whereas crude oil prices rose 44 percent (or 34 percent in real terms), natural gas and fertilizer prices both doubled (or 88 and 101 percent in real terms, respectively). As shown in the breakdown in the bar chart, most of the price growth occurred after the start of the war in Ukraine, except for fertilizer.",Open Access,,"Channing Arndt

87,"This policy note summarizes results of a study on the impact of COVID-19 on dairy value chains in Uganda. We use a stack survey consisting of 1616 dairy farmers, 695 small-scale milk traders, and 93 milk collection centers (MCCs) that were surveyed in-person in late 2018 as the basis for follow-up telephone interviews in 2020 and 2021. We find that the COVID-19 crisis mainly affected the dairy value chain through a reduction in demand as international trade reduced and households reduced consumption of more expensive foods due to income losses. As a result, prices drastically reduced at multiple stages of the value chain, and the number of actors affected by the price decrease worsened as the pandemic persisted. In general, we see that while dairy business closures during COVID-19 are limited, the joint reduction in demand and price leads to widespread reductions in scale of operation, dairy revenues and household income, although these somewhat recover over time, especially among MCCs. In the long-run, policy efforts to increase and stabilize local and export demand for dairy products seems most promising. For example, the government may institute policies that promote consumption of dairy products in schools and homes through information campaigns or temporary dairy vouchers. Government should also make it a priority to keep international trade flowing.",Open Access,2020 and 2021 dataset from the study on the Impact of COVID-19 on food value chains in Uganda,"Nabwire, Leocardia

This brief examines the impact of an MSD intervention (InovAgro) in Mozambique that was designed to increase incomes and improve economic security for poor smallholder farmers through improved productivity and development of high-potential value chains. Findings include increases in use of inputs and access to market information, as well as important spillover effects for many small-scale farmers beyond the direct beneficiaries, and high costs-effectiveness of the MSD intervention.",Open Access,,"Amare, Mulubrhan

89,"This policy note summarizes results of a study on the impact of COVID-19 on maize value chains in Uganda, which are characterized by a high degree of informality. We use a stack survey consisting of 1525 smallholder maize farmers, 341 informal traders, and 174 millers that were surveyed in-person in 2019 as the basis for follow-up telephone interviews in 2020 and 2021. We find that the impact of COVID-19 and associated measures manifests itself more downstream the value chain (at the level of the traders and particularly the millers). Closures and reductions in volumes passing through the chain seemed limited but worsen as the pandemic persists. Government measures such as a reduction of interest rates seemed to have brought some relief for traders and millers. However, all value chain actors report substantial reductions in maize revenues, household income and food security, as actors in informal value chains seem to rely on various activities to make ends meet. As a result, informal value chains such as maize in Uganda may be less able to adapt to common shocks in the long run. The appropriate policy response therefore would be to supplement some of the mitigating policies targeting businesses with more long run social protection policies to also benefit value chain actors upstream.",Open Access,2020 and 2020 dataset from the study on the impact of COVID-19 on food value chains in Uganda,"Nabwire, Leocardia

90,"Social safety nets (SSN) are cash or in-kind/food transfer programs designed to help individuals and households cope with chronic poverty, destitution, and vulnerability (World Bank, 2018). Some of these social protection programs include conditions or additional interventions that can enhance their impact on nutrition. Examples include attending health and nutrition services, targeting households with nutritionally vulnerable members (e.g., pregnant, and lactating women, children under 24 months), administration of transfers in a ender-sensitive manner, distributing transfers during periods of seasonal or climatic vulnerability, and focusing on emergencies (Ruel & Alderman, 2013; Alderman, 2016) developed a framework that identifies which of the World Bank ASPIRE categories of social safety nets have the potential to be nutrition sensitive.

93,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Guatemalan farmers have endured multiple challenges brough about by national and local restrictions to movement as well as disruptions in agricultural value chains. Similarly, farmers have been exposed to several external shocks such as ETA and IOTA tropical storms that hit the country in late 2020 and the recent conflict in East Europe and price crisis. This study examines the long-term effects of the COVID-19 environment on the food security and nutrition of rural households in the Western Highlands of Guatemala. The analysis is based on information from a panel of 1,262 smallholder households in the departments of Huehuetenango, Quiche, and San Marcos, collected during four survey rounds during November-December 2019 (face-to-face), May-June 2020 (by phone), May-June 2021 (by phone), and May-June 2022 (by phone). The study places special emphasis on evaluating changes in agricultural and non-agricultural income sources —including remittances—, and changes in dietary diversity —including consumption of animal-sourced foods (ASF) and fruits and vegetables (F&V)— at the household level, as well as among women between 15 and 49 years and children between 6 and 23 months. The results show some improvements in 2022 in income, food security and household dietary patterns in relation to previous years, but the levels are still lower than those reported before the pandemic (in 2019). The study also explores the effect of recent changes in the availability and prices of agricultural inputs faced by the smallholders as a result of the war between Ukraine and Russia, among other factors.",Open Access,,"Hernandez, Manuel A.

The PSNP provides food or cash transfers targeted to poor households in the form of payments for seasonal labor on public works or as direct support to households.

100,"Malawi is one of the most committed countries in Africa to improving nutrition, yet it still has one of the highest rates of malnutrition in the region and is struggling to turn commitments into action at scale. The advocacy component of the Afikepo project strengthened capacity of national and district government and Civil Society Organisation (CSO) representatives to plan, budget and advocate for scaling up nutrition commitments at national and in 10 districts. These actions improved awareness, coordination and commitment to prioritise nutrition across sectors, within government, and CSOs and a wide range of actors at national and district level, which in turn improved governance and accountability. However, these actions did not have a substantial effect on domestic funding allocations, which are still heavily reliant on external donors. This brief summarises lessons learned and recommendations from the various advocacy and capacity building efforts over the past four years.",Open Access,,"Nowa, Mphatso

101,"Malawi has strong policies and frameworks for nutrition but insufficient funding to implement them. Analyses of government budgets at national level and in 10 districts from financial years 2016/17 to 2022/23, found that domestic budget allocations for nutrition are still well below the 5% of national budget target set by the government. National budget allocations ranged between 0.5% to 3.7% depending on the year. At district level, they ranged from 0.2% to 1.6%, with only one district, in one financial year, exceeding the 1.5% target for district level nutrition budget allocations. Over 95% of nutrition activities in Malawi are currently funded by external donors. The absence of sufficient, consistent and dedicated domestic budget for nutrition at national and district level, means nutrition policies and plans will continue to be driven by, and dependent on, externally funded pilot-scale projects without national reach or ownership. Budget tracking is essential, as it provides data, which all actors can use to hold government to account on their commitments and funding targets.",Open Access,,"Nyirongo, Godwin

102,"A review of evidence was conducted to understand the trends and determinants of malnutrition and identify interventions and programmes that improved maternal and child nutrition in Malawi. While children are less malnourished than two decades ago, one in three children remains stunted (37%) and 63% are anaemic. Children born from younger and less educated mothers, or from poorer rural households are more likely to be malnourished. One in ten children are born with a low birth weight (< 2.5kgs), with nearly half of them stunted by age two. The main causes of malnutrition include recurring sickness, poor infant and young child feeding and hygiene practices and low use of health and nutrition services, influenced by a wide range of factors, including food insecurity, poverty, gender inequality and food taboos. Programme evaluations and intervention trials have shown mixed results but overall highlight the need to address the multiple underlying drivers of malnutrition, rather than focus on one intervention.",Open Access,,"Roschnik, Natalie

103,"Malawi has made significant progress in improving nutrition outcomes in the past decades. Despite this, the rates of stunting and anaemia remain high and overweight and obesity amongst women is rising. Malawi remains one of the most committed countries to nutrition, ranking 3rd out of 45 African countries on the Hunger and Nutrition Commitment Index, but effective implementation of policies is still challenging. Progress is being inhibited by a lack of dedicated budget lines for nutrition at district level, over reliance on external donors, poor coordination and competing priorities for limited resources within sectoral budgets. The pandemic, climate change and the Ukraine war have disrupted food systems, increased prices of fuel, fertilizer, and food, and caused loss of harvest and livelihoods, threatening to reverse decades of progress. Positive and coordinated action is needed to increase financial commitment to food and nutrition security, ensure nutrition is prioritised in the nation’s economic and development agenda, and continue Malawi’s progress to reducing malnutrition.",Open Access,,"Harris, Jody

104,"Resource-poor people face multiple risks and disturbances across social, economic, health, political, and environmental spheres. Included among these are conflict, public health threats, corruption, climate change, and natural resource degradation. The concept of resilience provides a useful framework for considering potential solutions to these intersecting challenges. This is particularly the case in situations where structural problems and inequalities—such as chronic poverty and gender gaps—underlie persistent and recurring shocks. Growing evidence shows that men and women have different exposure to shocks and stressors, and different preferences and capacities in terms of their responses. This stems from gendered social, cultural, and institutional contexts that shape such factors as their livelihood activities, roles, and bargaining power. Importantly, these factors are intrinsically linked with women’s empowerment levels, including their ability to access resources and make strategic life choices to improve their overall wellbeing. 
Because shocks and stressors occur in local contexts with different power structures, institutions, and sociocultural norms, it is difficult to generalize the different ways men and women are affected and choose to respond. Men’s and women’s experiences and reactions largely depend on the types of overlapping shocks and stressors they are exposed to. This brief highlights some of the key gendered dimensions of resilience, drawing on evidence from the literature, including systematic reviews and global indicators, where available, as well as case-study examples that highlight important linkages. The evidence summarized is intended to guide the development and implementation of gender-sensitive resilience interventions focusing on key programming areas of interest to Feed the Future’s Center for Resilience.",Open Access,,"Bryan, Elizabeth","CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS)",135212.pdf,135005,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

105,"This technical brief provides an overview of the digital development gaps and challenges in Guatemala's agrifood systems. Based on the USAID Digital Ecosystem Framework, 323 actors across 14 types of organizations were identified as digital agrifood innovators in the country. In-depth assessments on challenges and opportunities were conducted on 50 select actors using a new survey instrument, Rapid Screening Tool. We find that Guatemala has a good mix of founders, technical resources, an educated workforce, and a growing tech industry. The government's substantial efforts toward digital society, rights, and data governance were remarkable. However, major challenges constraining digital ecosystems were weak digital literacy, inadequate infrastructure, and low affordability of digital technologies and solutions for both users and service providers in rural areas. We recommend specific actions for CGIAR to support partners in realizing the transformative potential of digital innovations.",Open Access,,"Nagaraji, Satish

111,"Researcher–implementer partnerships are a subject of growing interest in CGIAR, and beyond, to help ensure research is relevant, cost-effective, and likely to scale up quickly among potential users. In 2021, as part of its synthesis strategy, the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) commissioned an external review of the International Food Policy Research Institute’s (IFPRI) researcher–implementer partnerships in the context of nutrition-sensitive programming.1 The objective of this external review was to characterize and evaluate IFPRI’s researcher–implementer partnerships with Helen Keller International (HKI) and the World Food Programme (WFP). In the context of this external review, “research–implementer partnership” referred to long-term partnerships between two organizations that lasted beyond the life of a single project or funding stream. This review aimed to characterize and document how researcher–implementer partnerships work, what factors facilitate or constrain these types of partnerships, and how the evidence generated by them influences changes in programs and policies at the partner organizations and beyond. The study was completed through a desk review of peer-reviewed and gray literature and a series of in-depth interviews with key informants from IFPRI, HKI, WFP, and staff from other implementing organizations, funding organizations, and academic institutions. In total, 15 individuals from 8 organizations were interviewed virtually in July and August 2021. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis.

There are several different ways that mobile money and services surrounding mobile money can help reduce poverty. For example, research demonstrates that mobile money helps increase remittances from labour migrants. It also helps households to weather negative shocks to income. In addition, it helps encourage investments whether on-farm or in self-employment activities.",Open Access,,"de Brauw, Alan

118,"Global food, fuel, and fertilizer prices have risen rapidly in recent months, driven in large part by the fallout from the ongoing war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia. Other factors, such as export bans, have also contributed to rising prices. Palm oil and wheat prices increased by 56 and 100 percent in real terms, respectively, between June 2021 and April 2022, with most of the increase occurring since February (Figure 1). Wide variation exists across products, with real maize prices increasing by only 11 percent and rice prices declining by 13 percent. The price of crude oil and natural gas has also risen substantially, while the weighted average price of fertilizer has doubled. With these changes in global prices, many developing countries and their development partners are concerned about the implications for economic stability, food security, and poverty.",Open Access,,"Diao, Xinshen

121,"The performance of agrifood value chains of vital importance for smallholder farmers in developing countries. Measuring and understanding how government policies, such taxes, subsidies, minimum support prices, and government procurement, impact particular value chains is essential to minimize unintended consequences for value chain actors. This analysis of distortions in value chains in Ethiopia (sheep and goats) and Nigeria (cacao and palm oil) uses nominal rates of protection (NRPs) to measure the impact of policies on domestic prices for producers and consumers. Using the NRP methodology is effective for highlighting the significant impact of agricultural policies on prices from the local to the country level and along entire agrifood value chains.",Open Access,,"Allen, Summer L.

124,"Rapid transformations are occurring in food systems around the world with significant economic, health, and environmental implications. As part of this change, the focus of agricultural production needs to transition from quantity of food production to quality of diets. This brief begins by summarizing evidence from nutrition-sensitive agriculture and explaining how resource tenure and governance issues relate to the production of nutrient-rich foods. The brief then explores the importance of resource tenure and governance issues for diets and health in the context of food system transformation: this section focuses on supporting healthy diets in traditional food systems, meeting the global demand for nutrient-rich foods, and managing and mitigating disease risks in intensifying agricultural landscapes.",Open Access,,"Johnson, Nancy L.","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",135009.pdf,134786,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

125,"Governance refers to how decisions and rules, as well as decision-making rules, are made and by whom. This brief on landscape governance focuses specifically on the decision-making processes that seek to create and enforce socially binding agreements regarding people’s interactions with one another and the landscape around them (Matson, Clark, and Andersson 2016). Landscape governance and its agreements shape how people treat each other and how they use local natural resources. Landscape governance agreements can address concrete questions, such as: How much forestland can a landowner clear each year? When are farmers allowed to burn crop residues? Where may pastoral groups take their cattle? and What is the punishment for breaking a given rule? The agreements, if achieved, may also define who has the right to participate in governance decision-making and who enforces the rules. Figure 1 below provides a simplified overview of the different parts of the landscape governance process, how it shapes local decisions and actions, and how it is influenced by decisions at higher levels of political authority.",Open Access,,"Andersson, Krister","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",135007.pdf,134793,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

126,"Gender relations in households and communities play a formative role in how tenure rights — such as access to, use, and management of land and various natural resources — are practiced across multifunctional landscapes. Such rights can be based on statutory recognition or on customary tenure arrangements. Women’s tenure rights are generally weaker than men’s, both in terms of the range of rights they can assert and the degree of authority over those rights. In addition, women often hold a more informal and negotiated set of rights than men, be it for private or collective use of land and natural resources. These gender differences are the outcome of decision-making and governance at the household and community level. In any rural landscape in developing countries, a household’s livelihood portfolio will be affected by the gender dynamics at work across the landscape mosaic of different tenure niches. For example, women may easily access privately owned home gardens (one type of tenure niche) to harvest a range of vegetables, fruits, and medicinal plants, but not so easily access trees in collective forests for harvesting timber to sell in the market.",Open Access,,"Jhaveri, Nayna","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",135010.pdf,134790,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

128,"Collaborative international research on tenure dates back at least to the early 1960s when the Land Tenure Centre was established at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and conducted some studies in collaboration with CGIAR social scientists. CGIAR interest in tenure increased in the early 1990s when natural resource management was strengthened as a component of the CGIAR agenda and the Centers on forests, agroforestry, and water (CIFOR, ICRAF, and IWMI) entered the system. CAPRi began to operate as a systemwide research program on tenure and collective action in the mid-1990s, and became PIM Flagship 5 on governance of natural resources in 2011.

129,"Agricultural research and experimental development (R&D) investment is positively associated with high returns, but these returns take time—often decades—to develop. Consequently, the inherent lag from the inception of research to the adoption of new technologies calls for sustained and stable R&D funding. In 2016, Africa invested just 0.39 percent of its agricultural gross domestic product (AgGDP) in agricultural R&D, down from 0.54 percent in 2000. Furthermore, only a handful of African countries invest at least 1 percent of their AgGDP in agricultural research; the target set by New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). Even though in absolute terms total R&D investment has increased since the turn of the millennium—after a period of stagnation—most of the funds have been directed toward research staff expansion, salary increases, and rehabilitation of derelict research infrastructure and equipment, rather than actual research programs. In fact, in a large number of African countries, the national government funds the salaries of researchers and support staff, but little else, leaving nonsalary-related expenses highly dependent on donors and other funding sources.",Open Access,,African Union,"CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",135002.pdf,134792,,,,,2021-11-23,2021-11-24,2021-12-01,"Fourth Ordinary Session of the Specialized Technical Committee (STC) on Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment (ARDWE) 13th – 17th December 2021, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","African Union. 2021.

Other factors may shape policy uptake — for instance, elections may alter policy priorities, ideological biases may hinder the acceptance of research findings, and vested interest groups may lobby against data-driven or evidence-informed recommendations. A political economy perspective allows for a more holistic and realistic understanding of how policies are determined by governments and which pathways are more viable for achieving development outcomes through policy change.",Open Access,,"Resnick, Danielle","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",134650.pdf,134440,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

132,"The UNFSS Dialogue on Women, Work and Food Systems identified a game-changing solution on management of commons: natural resources that are held and used collectively. The commons support food systems through direct production and provision of water, food, fuel, fodder, pollination, and other key ecosystem services, as well as important sources of resilience for communities. They thus contribute to nature-positive solutions and advance equitable livelihoods. Yet the commons are under pressure from encroachment and overuse. This side event presented evidence from a new study of the value of ecosystem services from the commons in India, as well as how strengthening governance of the commons can support equitable food systems. Harpinder Sandhu, Senior Lecturer at the University of South Australia, presented the collaborative study, followed by an overview of the FES Promise of Commons initiative by Senior Program Manager Pratiti Priyadarshini. Harini Nagendra, Director of Research Center at Azim Premji University, and Insa Theesfeld, in her capacity as the president of the International Association for the Study of the Commons, discussed the importance of safeguarding and restoring the commons and going beyond economic valuation of ecosystem services.",Open Access,,"International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

133,"According to the OECD’s recently released 2021 Agricultural Policy Monitoring and Evaluation Report, governments of some 54 countries provide transfers to agriculture totaling about $720 billion annually. The report, presented at the side event by Jonathan Brooks of OECD, notes that “Overall, most current support policies are not serving the wider needs of food systems.” This substantial spending could offer a way to finance food systems transformation, including reducing the carbon footprint of food systems while gaining resilience, improving food security and nutritional outcomes, and enhancing poverty reduction and equity. The proposition for restructuring or repurposing agricultural support has been put forward as a game-changing solution for the UNFSS. Rob Vos presented recent IFPRI research on the potential for repurposing agricultural subsidies to finance both mitigation of greenhouse gas (GhG) emissions and enhancement of agricultural productivity. Simply removing distorting agricultural support is not sufficient to reduce GhG emissions, according to the study. But emission-reducing agricultural productivity growth could be boosted by shifting current spending on agriculture toward more appropriate R&D and compensating farmers for any losses they incur from subsidy removal and for the upfront costs of adopting more sustainable technologies and production practices.",Open Access,,"International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

134,"Gender equality is a precondition for achieving the world’s shared ambitions of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, including delivering sustainable food systems. Gender is intricately linked to all components of food systems. Gender inequalities are both a cause and an outcome of unsustainable food systems and unjust food access, consumption, and production. In the lead-up to the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit, IFPRI and its partners have selected 10 transformative areas of action to promote gender-equitable food systems. One of these areas is gender-responsive and gender-equitable leadership in food systems under Action Track 1 on Ensuring Access to Safe and Nutritious Foods. Among these actions, stakeholders have committed to establishing a global mechanism to monitor progress and hold food systems organizations accountable for achieving gender equality in leadership, setting gender-equitable internal workplace policies, and implementing strategies that advance progress toward gender-just and equitable food systems.",Open Access,,"Global Health 50/50

140,"The UNFSS Side Event on Gender Equality, Women’s Empowerment, and Food Systems underscored the importance of addressing gender equality to transform food systems. While there is a broad consensus in the literature about how to improve gender equality and women’s empowerment in food systems, there is little evidence on causal pathways or processes. This side event presented evidence from a new review of evidence on gender equality, women’s empowerment, and food systems. Dr. Jemimah Njuki, Director for Africa, IFPRI, presented the findings from the review.

143,"KEY MESSAGES
• A recent external review of IFPRI’s research on agricultural insurance found that, since 2009, IFPRI has made important contributions to the literature on factors constraining farmers’ demand for agricultural insurance and on gender inclusiveness of insurance and, since 2015, has focused more specifically on developing new forms of insurance that can reduce basis risk at the farm level and make insurance more attractive to farmers.
• IFPRI’s work on flexible insurance contracts, picture-based insurance, and bundling agricultural insurance with credit, seeds, and other agricultural services shows that well-designed insurance can significantly improve on standard index products, increase demand among smallholders, and lead to greater use of bundled inputs like improved seeds and climate-smart farming practices.
• ILRI’s long-term success with its index-based livestock insurance (IBLI) product illustrates that an action-oriented approach aimed at working with strong implementing partners on the ground ensures that, when a product is successful, it has the potential to scale up quickly, leading to significant development impacts.
• Important knowledge gaps that warrant further CGIAR research include:
1) segmenting product design and marketing strategies for different target groups, such as sustainable commercial insurance and inclusive insurance; 2) the value and optimal design of programs and policies to remove tail-end catastrophic risks, and of insurance more broadly within a more holistic risk management framework; and 3) cost-benefit analyses around the net social benefits of insurance subsidies, and how these subsidies can best be designed and targeted to achieve their purposes.",Open Access,,"Kramer, Berber

144,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a significant threat to public health throughout most of the world as the coronavirus continues to spread, mostly unchecked by limited availability of vaccines, and largescale surges in cases are fed by new variants of the virus. In Ethiopia, surges in COVID-19 cases after months of apparently low levels of infection have periodically required renewed restrictions locally to control the spread of the virus. Thus, it is necessary to review available date to understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on households in Ethiopia, and particularly on the poorest households, who are more vulnerable to protracted effects of the virus and associated restrictions on activity as a result of their limited resources. We present results of two rounds of a phone survey, conducted in June and August 2020, respectively, of around 1,200 rural households. All households in the sample are beneficiaries of the fourth phase of Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP4) and also participate in the USAID-funded Strengthening PSNP4 Institutions and Resilience (SPIR) project, implemented by World Vision, CARE and ORDA in North Wollo and Wag Himra zones in Amhara, and primarily in East and West Hararghe zones in Oromia. The targeted phone survey respondents were adult males from sample households in IFPRI’s experimental impact evaluation of SPIR who provided a phone number during the 2019 midline survey. This is a subsample of the broader SPIR evaluation sample as 33% of households provided a phone number and thus were eligible for inclusion in the phone survey. Available evidence suggests that households who provided a phone number are characterized by higher socioeconomic status vis-à-vis other SPIR households in the study sample who did not provide a phone number. However, as all households in the phone survey are SPIR beneficiaries, they are still relatively poor in the broader context of rural Ethiopia. We report evidence from the two survey rounds on coronavirus awareness and protective measures taken; changes in livelihoods, including crop production and livestock raising; access to and utilization of markets; changes in food consumption and food security; experience with desert locusts and fall armyworms; and exposure to public programming.",Open Access,,"Alderman, Harold

145,"Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is a global public health crisis and human rights violation, with adverse consequences for women and girls, economies as a whole, and future generations. Existing multicountry evidence suggests that the high prevalence of VAWG in low- and middle-income countries could be holding back advances in many priority areas — such as education (Gennari et al. 2014), health (Ellsberg et al. 2008), nutrition (Yount et al. 2011), adaptation to climate change (Le Masson et al. 2019), and adoption of sustainable livelihoods (Morrison and Orlando 2004). In the context of agricultural development, VAWG can reduce agency (Theis et al. 2018) — preventing women from seeking control over assets and income (instrumental agency), participating in groups (collective agency), and building self-worth (intrinsic agency). In addition, fear of sexual harassment and/or sexual violence in public spaces can induce girls or women to choose lower quality educational outcomes (Borker 2021), limit their opportunities for safe and decent work (Nordehn 2018), and depress their labor market participation (Chakraborty et al. 2018, Siddique 2021).",Open Access,,"Hidrobo, Melissa

150,"Seed is a critical input for agricultural production. In many developing countries, limited access to and availability of quality seeds affects farmers’ food and nutrition security and impedes efforts to make agrifood systems more productive, inclusive, environmentally sustainable, and nutrition sensitive. Research on seed systems is a key component of the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM). Two recent outcomes of this work include the revision and implementation of the seed policy in Uganda and the registration of 11 local varieties of beans, rice, fingermillet, proso millet, amaranth and cucumber used by farmers in Nepal. Both achievements contribute to enhanced quality assurance for popular varieties commercialized by farmers at the local level.",Open Access,,"CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)

154,"Safety net programs generally employ thresholds (using a set benchmark of assets, income, or a timeline) to graduate beneficiaries off program support (Browne 2013; Sabates-Wheeler and Devereux 2011). However, many participants in short-term programs fall back to preprogram vulnerability and poverty levels within a short time (Sabates-Wheeler and Devereux 2011), suggesting that threshold-based graduation is an inappropriate way to determine the capability of participants to leave the program. Thus, the concept of “sustainable graduation” has been put forward to better assess the ability of a household to withstand shocks without damaging losses (Sabates-Wheeler and Devereux 2013).",Open Access,,"Hauser, Michael

155,"Safety nets protect vulnerable households when their livelihoods are deteriorating. Safety nets are offered to people through different instruments. Traditional asset programs transfer material goods, including farm implements and livestock if participants are farmers.

156,"Tenure insecurity has a variety of negative consequences for natural resource management, agricultural productivity, and poverty reduction, but the sources of tenure insecurity differ for men and women, and for individual, household, and collective lands.
Research supported through PIM has helped advance policy reforms that improve access to, and tenure security of, land and natural resources and has supported more equitable and sustainable use of resources in less developed regions.
Statutory recognition of customary rights, multistakeholder processes such as for land use planning, and organized social alliances such as Indigenous Peoples’ groups have emerged as important mechanisms for securing rights or enhancing access to collectively held lands.
Long-term partnerships, ongoing engagement, and training for multiple actors at multiple scales increases the likelihood of successful implementation of tenure reforms.
Further research on tenure security can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, especially by clarifying how customary tenure can provide security and how tenure affects decision-making in multistakeholder platforms.",Open Access,,"McLain, Rebecca","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",135146.pdf,134937,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

159,"Efforts to promote the development of agricultural value chains are a common element of strategies to stimulate economic growth in low-income countries. Since the world food price crisis in 2007-2008, developing country governments, international donor agencies, and development practitioners have placed additional emphasis on making agricultural value chains work better for the poor. As value chains evolve to serve new markets, they tend to become less inclusive. For example, if a market for high quality rice arises within an economy, it is inherently easier for traders who sell rice to retailers to source that high quality rice from larger farms that are better able to control its quality than from dozens of smallholder farms. As a result, the normal path of value chain evolution can be biased against smallholders; hence, it is important to understand what types of interventions can make value chains more inclusive while also making them more efficient. 
In this brief, we summarize studies on five types of value chain interventions that were supported by the CGIAR’s Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM) through its Flagship 3 on Inclusive and Effective Value Chains. Figure 1 illustrates a “typical” agricultural value chain, including the five intervention types (in orange). These include interventions that attempt to deal with multiple production constraints; certification; contract farming; public-private partnerships; and “other” services related to trading and marketing agricultural products. Apart from the last category, these interventions all involve production. This reflects the fact that smallholder producers can be considered, in some ways, the weakest link in evolving agricultural value chains (de Brauw and Bulte 2021). Hence, it is sensible to target interventions either at or close to smallholders. However, in some cases, the best way to overcome smallholder constraints may be to help actors at other points in the value chain overcome constraints. Many interventions share a focus on reducing transaction costs to promote smallholder market integration. Ideally, interventions increase both efficiency and inclusion, but we observe that such win-win outcomes are rare. Trade-offs appear to be more common than synergies, and some value chain interventions involve clear winners and losers.",Open Access,,"de Brauw, Alan

160,"Over the past 20 years, value chain development (VCD) initiatives and value chain research have increasingly integrated gender dimensions to allow for gender-differentiated employment and income opportunities and other benefits for women and men, and to address the exploitation of women’s labor (Pyburn and Kruijssen 2021). This research often addresses constraints to women’s participation in specific value chains, such as administrative procedures in transboundary fish trade (Ratner et al. 2018) or disproportionate harassment of women food traders by authorities in Nigeria (Resnick et al. 2019). This brief draws on research conducted under the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM) to illustrate how VCD supports and constrains progress toward gender equality and women’s empowerment. In particular, the brief summarizes work from a portfolio of six PIM co-funded projects (2020–2021) on gender dynamics in value chains beyond the production node and single commodity analysis (Box 1), a book chapter in a CGIAR-wide gender publication (Pyburn and van Eerdewijk 2021), the Pro-WEAI (project-level Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index) for Market Inclusion, and other gender-integrated value chain work within PIM (Crimi 2018; Vos and Pyburn 2021), and provides an outlook for future research.",Open Access,,"Pyburn, Rhiannon

161,"Customary pastoral tenure and governance systems are relatively broad sets of institutions characterized by principles of collectivity, flexibility, adaptability, and multiple uses by multiple users (Davies et al. 2016; Flintan et al. 2021). These tenure systems are becoming ever more complex as livelihoods and land use diversify and as pastoralists attempt to access land and resources through mechanisms other than their customary institutions, including through privatization and formalized land certification (Flintan et al. 2021; Nori 2021). The resulting tenure systems are described by Robinson (2019) as “complex mosaics.” Alternatively, Flintan (2021) (following Niamir-Fuller 2005) refers to them as “nested” systems where regulating laws and institutions work on the basis of “territory” or “domain,” under which there is a hierarchy of nested, overlapping bundles of rights for diverse sets of users and often for the same resource. Despite these complexities, collective tenure continues to be core, ensuring pastoralist systems function well and their resilience to crises such as drought is strengthened.",Open Access,,"Flintan, Fiona","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",135157.pdf,134947,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

The focus of this work is the governance of natural resources and policy and institutions for improved natural resources management. This body of research analyzes how tenure security affects sustainable management and how individuals, groups, and communities govern land, water, fish stocks, and forests. An important focus of this work involves the following questions: (1) who has what rights with respect to these resources (particularly for women and members of marginalized groups), (2) what are their roles in managing natural resources, and (3) what livelihood benefits do they receive? Without a contextualized understanding of these questions, policies and practices can inadvertently exclude women, reinforce historical practices of gender injustice, or introduce new inequalities that worsen natural resource management and poverty.",Open Access,,"Kristjanson, Patricia

163,"In both developed and developing countries, governments often intervene in the agriculture sector to support development and to respond to political-economy pressures, using trade policies or price support for particular agricultural commodities. To understand the full implications of agricultural policies, it is necessary to correctly measure the extent to which policies and their derivatives distort market prices of commodities, and to understand the implications of protection provided to other sectors that affects agricultural incentives through real exchange rate impacts.  Multiple international organizations (IOs) provide assessment and measurement of agricultural incentives. However, a comprehensive and long-term global database would enable analysts and policymakers to compare and interpret the impact of policy across commodities, countries, and time.  To facilitate construction and dissemination of such a database, the Ag-Incentives Consortium was formed in 2013 to bring together institutional efforts, including those of the Inter-American Development Bank, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Monitoring and Analysing Food and Agricultural Policies program of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO-MAFAP), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and World Bank, as well as the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM). The Ag-Incentives Consortium is the “International Organizations Consortium for Measuring the Policy Environment for Agriculture” and is based on the Memorandum of Understanding for Co-operative Activities on Agricultural Incentives Measurement signed by OECD, FAO-MAFAP, IDB, World Bank, and IFPRI.

164,"It is estimated that nearly one in seven people — more than 1 billion in total — are classified as migrants in national statistics. Of these, about 763 million are estimated to be internal migrants; the remaining 281 million are international migrants (International Organization for Migration 2021). Migration is an intrinsic part of the development process, representing one of the greatest opportunities to facilitate economic and social advancement in developing countries. Understanding how different types of individuals and households perceive these opportunities and overcome related constraints, and how these change over time, is of key interest. At the same time, migration presents one of the world’s biggest challenges, requiring adjustments by both sending and hosting communities, and understanding those adjustments is a priority. The CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM) has undertaken more than 40 studies designed to explore the causes and consequences of internal and international migration. In aggregate, the studies help us understand what motivates people to migrate and what factors impinge on their ability to do so. These studies focused on the relationship of migration with rural transformation, gender, youth, climate change, and social protection and cut across the whole PIM research portfolio. This brief synthesizes findings from this research in an attempt to present a more complete picture. While there is a vast literature on migration external to PIM and CGIAR, the results of the PIM investiga­tions constitute valuable inputs into national pol­icies and programs designed to foster economic and social development while maximizing the benefits and reducing the risks of migration.",Open Access,,"CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets (PIM)","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",134826.pdf,134615,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

165,"Sustainable agricultural practices enable more efficient use of natural resources, mitigate the impact of agriculture on the environment, and strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change and climate variability. Because these practices usually require substantial effort or resource allocation from farmers, incentives are necessary to support farmer adoption. Despite growing interest, there has been little systematic evaluation of the incentives–adoption–outcome chain—that is, which incentives best promote adoption and which lead to desired sustainability outcomes. This brief presents the results of a literature review that examined (1) uptake agricultural practices under three kinds of incentives, market and nonmarket, regulations, and cross-compliance, and (2) the impact on productivity, profitability, and environmental sustainability. Based on this review, it offers a set of seven tested principles to follow in designing and implementing incentives for sustainable agriculture.",Open Access,,"Piñeiro, Valeria

This includes formal and informal actors of the food supply chains (from producers to street vendors) as well as consumers, in both rural and urban environments.

176,"Agricultural extension provides the critical connection from agricultural innovation and discovery to durable improvements at scale, as farmers and other actors in the rural economy learn, adapt, and innovate with new technologies and practices. However, lack of capacity and performance of agricultural extension in lower- and middle-income countries is an ongoing concern. Research on agricultural extension and advisory services (in short, extension) has been an integral part of the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM) since its inception. This brief synthesizes key findings from research funded by and linked to PIM from 2012 to 2021, presenting lessons learned and a vision for the future of extension. A list of all PIM-related extension and advisory services research is provided at the end.
Designing and implementing effective provision of extension is complex, and efforts to strengthen extension services often fall into a trap of adopting “best practice” blueprint approaches that are not well-tailored to local conditions. An expansive literature examines the promises and pitfalls of common approaches, including training-and-visit extension systems, farmer field schools, and many others (Anderson and Feder 2004; Anderson et al. 2006; Waddington and White 2014; Scoones and Thompson 2009). To understand extension systems and build evidence for what works and where, the “best-fit” framework, a widely recognized approach developed by Birner and colleagues (2009) and adapted by Davis and Spielman (2017), offers a simple impact chain approach (Figure 1). The framework focuses on a defined set of extension service characteristics that affect performance: governance structures and funding; organizational and management capacities and cultures; methods; and community engagement — all of which are subject to external factors such as the policy environment, agroecological conditions, and farming-system heterogeneity. To enhance extension performance and, ultimately, a wide range of outcomes and impacts, new and innovative interventions can be applied and adapted within this set of extension characteristics.",Open Access,,"Davis, Kristin E.

182,"Tremendous optimism prevails around bottomup accountability — a situation in which citizens effectively hold their government to account. This contrasts with top-down accountability, whereby higher tiers of governments, donors, or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) fulfill this role by restraining, monitoring, and rewarding or sanctioning government. Bottom-up accountability can involve direct citizen participation  (often involving efforts to provide them information, voice, and involvement in policymaking) or can be mediated through civil society organizations (CSOs) that monitor and potentially reward or sanction government. A large variety of different types of CSOs exist, distinguished both by their organizational purpose and the composition of their membership, possibly with different willingness and ability to hold government accountable.",Open Access,,"Bleck, Jaimie

186,"How do social protection programs influence agricultural growth and nutrition, and what are the implications of this for program design? PIM research on the impact of social protection programs and complementary interventions for agricultural growth and nutrition made significant contributions to research and policy, including through impact evaluations of national food and cash transfer programs (e.g., the Takaful and Karama Program in Egypt, the Productive Safety Net Program in Ethiopia, and the Programme de Filets Sociaux “Jigisemejiri” in Mali), pilot studies (in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Tanzania, and Yemen), and policy papers and review studies covering many low- and middle-income countries. Social protection programs that provide cash or in-kind transfers alone often show limited short-term effects on agriculture or nutrition outcomes, although there is evidence of impacts of cash transfers alone on child nutrition in cases of extreme deprivation or when transfers are very large. The flagship’s research shows that social protection programs that bundle cash or in-kind transfers with high-quality complementary programming can generate large, significant improvements in agriculture and nutrition outcomes. Such complementary programming includes agricultural extension and nutrition behavior change communication (BCC).",Open Access,,"CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",134588.pdf,134376,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

How can agricultural technologies, natural resource management practices, and investment in infrastructure address these challenges in ways that manage trade-offs, protect natural capital, and sustain the provision of ecosystem services? PIM researchers analyzed the consequences of a number of key drivers for the future development of food systems. The primary focus has been on climate change, population and income growth, food prices, and their combined effects on dietary preferences, health, and the environment, as well as on the role of changing technology and responses to investments in key components of the food system. A body of work comprised of ground-breaking original research and review studies was made possible by the successful building of a community of practice on foresight that brought together researchers across CGIAR with collaborators from academia and centers of excellence all over the world.",Open Access,,"CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",134589.pdf,134377,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

188,"Malnutrition, largely attributable to poor diets among both the rich and poor, presents a growing challenge in Nigeria. This brief considers the obstacles to food security and better nutrition, particularly the country’s macroeconomic instability, widespread poverty, and the need for greater investment and policy coherence to support dietary diversity. The authors describe how a policy shift to focus on consumer needs can transform the agrifood system to deliver healthier and more affordable diets for all Nigerians, as well as better and more secure rural livelihoods.",Open Access,,"Ecker, Olivier

190,"By 2050, 95 percent of Earth’s land will be degraded. Already, 24 billion tons of soil have been eroded by unsustainable agriculture (Larbodière et al. 2020). In 2020 alone, over 4 million hectares of primary forest were cleared, up 12 percent from 2019. Global trade, consumption, population growth, and urbanization are driving transformations that, in part, drive the destruction of nature. The 2020 Global Living Planet Index shows a 68 percent drop in populations of monitored species from 1970 to 2016. Such trends are a measure of declining ecosystem health (WWF 2020), and the World Economic Forum ranks biodiversity loss as a top-five risk to the global economy. Clearly, our environment must be high on political and policy agendas — yet too often environmental governance is weak and policy implementation is neglected.",Open Access,,"Barrow, Edmund","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",134993.pdf,134782,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

198,"Rural transformation is central to the broader structural transformation process taking place in developing countries — fueled by the globalization of value chains, changing food systems, new technologies, conflict and displacement, and climate change, among other factors. Rural transformation refers to the process whereby rural economies diversify into nonfarm activities, agriculture becomes more capital-intensive and commercially oriented, and linkages with neighboring towns and cities grow and deepen (Berdegué, Rosada, and Bebbington 2014). It can bring about fundamental changes in the way businesses and households organize, such as the commercialization and diversification of agricultural production; increased agricultural productivity; migration; and the emergence of a broader set of rural livelihood activities.",Open Access,,"Kosec, Katrina

200,"Agricultural research spending in Vietnam has increased steadily since 2000. Nonetheless, as of 2017, Vietnam only invested 0.20 percent of its AgGDP in agricultural research, which is insufficient to address the multitude of challenges the agricultural sector is facing. The country has made considerable progress in building its agricultural research capacity. Average degree levels of scientists have improved markedly over time. Recent growth in agricultural research spending and staffing is likely to be reversed in the coming years because the Vietnamese government plans to reduce public research staffing and take steps to stimulate private research and funding.",Open Access,,"Stads, Gert-Jan

202,"Recent policy debates have focused renewed international attention on poultry as an asset that is widely accessible to women and has low start-up costs, increasing its potential to have significant positive welfare effects for poor households in developing countries. In 2016, Bill Gates promoted investment in chickens as a development strategy that would meaningfully increase incomes for poor women.1 In response, Chris Blattman suggested that large cash grants of the kind provided by Give Directly (Haushofer and Shapiro 2016) may be more effective at enhancing outcomes, given heterogeneity in households’ needs and capacity to raise chickens.2 This learning brief reports on evidence from an ongoing impact evaluation of a complementary program to Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program, Phase 4 (PSNP4), called SPIR (Strengthen PSNP4 Institutions and Resilience) in rural Ethiopia, in which a cross-randomization of interventions providing poultry and cash transfers allows us to generate evidence highly relevant to this debate. The SPIR Development Food Security Activity (DFSA) in Ethiopia is a five-year program (2016–2021) supporting implementation of the PSNP4 as well as complementary livelihood, nutrition, gender, and natural resource management activities intended to strengthen the program and expand its impacts. Under funding from USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and in close collaboration with the Government of Ethiopia, World Vision leads implementation of the SPIR DFSA in partnership with the Organization for Rehabilitation and Development in Amhara (ORDA) and CARE. SPIR DFSA targets more than 500,000 PNSP clients in 15 of the most vulnerable woredas in Amhara and Oromia regions of Ethiopia. SPIR DFSA also incorporates a substantial learning agenda intended to use evidence to improve the design of the DFSA, provide feedback to strengthen its delivery, and draw lessons both for local gov-ernment and other national and international stakeholders. World Vision, ORDA, and CARE provide guidance on the implementation of the learning agenda. IFPRI leads the planning and execution of the learning agenda activities. This learning brief reports midline effects of two specific dimensions of SPIR programming, a poultry package and a one-time cash transfer randomized to women in particularly poor households, on a set of livelihood outcomes measured in the midline survey conducted between July and October 2019.",Open Access,,"Leight, Jessica

203,"In a recent study, adolescents living in Addis Ababa reported that food safety and affordability were their top concerns when making food purchases. Nutrition was a secondary concern: the students reported that even if the food sold were healthy, they would not purchase it if the vendor or outlet did not appear clean. Packaged foods were often perceived as healthy choices among the adolescents because they have labels featuring information such as expiry dates and the packaging is perceived to protect these foods from germs. Involving adolescents and their families in future research, programming, and interventions can help convey messages about the importance of nutrition. Providing clean, affordable, and healthy food options in and around schools can help ensure adolescents are able to choose and consume foods that meet all these important criteria. Ensuring that the food-based dietary guidelines under devel­opment in Ethiopia are used to provide nutrition education could help adolescents apply the guidelines in their daily life.",Open Access,,"Trübswasser, Ursula

204,"Chili pepper (Capsicum spp.) is an important spice and condiment used in many Ghanaian dishes. Alongside tomato and onion, chili ranks as one of Ghana’s three most important vegetable crops in terms of hectarage and crop value with significant potential for generating income, creating jobs, and contributing to foreign exchange through exports (Gonzalez et al. 2014). As is the case with other vegetable crops, chili production in Ghana is more profitable than producing traditional staple crops, such as maize and rice (Van Asselt et al. 2018). However, supply is highly seasonal as most production is rainfed. Chili yields in Ghana are also well below their potential. The government of Ghana has recognized this underexploited potential by designating chili as a priority crop under the Planting for Food Jobs (PFJ) initiative.",Open Access,,"Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA)

205,"Rice is an important staple in Ghana and is cultivated across all agroecological zones. Paddy rice output grew at around 10 percent per annum between 2008 and 2019, with an especially sharp increase of 25 percent in 2019. However, domestic production continues to fall short of demand with the import share of rice consumed remaining above 50 percent (MoFA 2018). This reflects a growing preference for rice among Ghanaian households, especially as consumers become wealthier and more urbanized. The large dependence on rice imports heightens concerns around foreign exchange imbalances and vulnerability to international rice price shocks. Hence, the National Rice Development Strategy of 2009 and the Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) campaign launched in 2017 not only prioritize rice but set ambitious expansion targets for domestic rice production (MOFA 2017a). Policy objectives include substituting rice imports and producing a higher-quality product that is more acceptable to Ghanaian consumers and can compete with imported rice.",Open Access,,"Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA)

206,"Burkina Faso has made impressive improvements in nutrition over the last 30 years. Stunting rates among children under five have declined (from 45% in 1998/99 to 25% in 2018) and known nutrition drivers have improved. As a sector, nutrition has risen among national priorities, enacted several nutritionspecific policies, and increased funding. Despite these achievements, many challenges remain. This brief— based on research from the Stories of Change in Burkina Faso report—aims to tell the story of Burkina Faso’s success in nutrition, identify its challenges, and provide evidence-based recommendations to address challenges now and in the future.",Open Access,,"Turowska, Zuzanna

207,"Tomatoes are a key component in the diets of Ghanaian households. Approximately 440,000 tons of tomato are consumed annually, equivalent to 40 percent of household vegetable expenditure (Van Asselt et al. 2018). Despite government support for the sector, national production has not increased much in the last decade, resulting in domestic supply falling far short of demand. While UN Comtrade (2019) trade statistics for 2007 to 2017 indicate that the country imported only around 8,000 tons of tomato annually, mainly from neighboring Burkina Faso, Van Asselt et al. (2018) put this figure at closer to 100,000 tons or one-quarter of domestic supply. Evidently, large quantities of tomato enter the country informally, making it difficult to estimate actual supply and demand patterns and devise appropriate marketing policies. The perishability of tomato is a major challenge and imparts significant risk on producers and traders. As such, post-harvest handling, transport, storage, and processing losses have been estimated at between 20 and 65 percent of production (Vowotor et al. 2012).",Open Access,,"Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA)

208,"As social protection programs and systems adapt to mitigate against the COVID-19 crisis, gender considerations are likely to be overlooked in an urgent effort to save lives and provide critical economic support. Yet, past research and learning indicates that small adaptations to make program design and implementation more gender-sensitive may result in overall and equality-related gains. We summarize some of these considerations for LMICs across five areas: 1) Adapting existing schemes and social protection modality choice, 2) targeting, 3) benefit level and frequency, 4) delivery mechanisms and operational features, and 5) complementary programming. It is our hope that COVID-19 will be an opportunity to address, and not exacerbate, pre-existing gender inequalities and lay the groundwork for more gender-sensitive social protection programming in LMICs beyond the crisis, building toward the wellbeing of societies as a whole.",Open Access,,"Hidrobo, Melissa

209,"Maize is a widely consumed and cultivated staple crop in Ghana. It accounts for more than one-quarter of calories consumed, about double that of the second crop, cassava (GSS 2018). About three-quarters of maize consumption is from own production, suggesting maize has limited appeal as a cash crop (Gage et al. 2012). This is set to change as Ghana’s Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) initiative, launched in 2017, prioritizes maize seed and fertilizer distribution and encourages market participation by smallholders (MoFA 2019). Already average maize output over the period 2017 to 2019 has been 40 percent higher than the average output achieved between 2013 and 2016 (MoFA 2020a). Government attributes this dramatic production response to PFJ. It is uncertain whether the maize market in Ghana can absorb increased this increased maize output without significant impacts on market prices or the profitability of maize cultivation.",Open Access,,"Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA)

211,"Nigeria faces a growing triple burden of malnutrition. First, chronic childhood undernutrition remains stubbornly high. Nationwide, 36.8% of children under five years were estimated to be stunted in 2018—only slightly down from 40.8% in 2008. This corresponds to an annual average decline of less than 0.4 percentage points over the last decade and was almost exclusively due to a reduction in the prevalence of child stunting in urban areas (Table 1). Second, micronutrient malnutrition, including iron deficiency anemia, is extremely widespread among young children and women of reproductive age. While the prevalence rate of anemia among children under five years slightly declined in rural areas between 2010 and 2018, it substantially increased in urban areas. Third, overweight and obesity among adults has been rising rapidly in both urban and rural areas. Over the last decade, the national prevalence rates of overweight and obesity (the extreme form of overnutrition) among nonpregnant women 15 to 49 years of age increased faster than the rate of child stunting decreased, driving the growth of the triple burden. Obesity significantly increases the risk of diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (like heart attack and stroke), and hypertension. The root cause of all forms of malnutrition is poor dietary quality, while poor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) conditions aggravate malnutrition.",Open Access,,"Ecker, Olivier

212,"Ethiopia has made major strides in improving nutrition in the past two decades; the prevalence of stunting decreased considerably from 58% in 2000 to 38% in 2016 and further to 37% in 2018.1 While there is no consensus on the underlying causes of this improvement—although substantial increases in income and education surely contributed—there is consensus that more must be done to maintain the momentum. In particular, a number of infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices can be improved. While breastfeeding initiation is nearly universal, many children are not exclusively breastfed until they are 6 months old, which is the recommended practice. Similarly, few children age 6–23 months meet the minimum acceptable dietary standards. This brief presents evidence on the impact of the SPIR project on key IYCF practices at the time of the midline survey.",Open Access,,"Alderman, Harold

213,"The Knowledge for Implementation and Impact Initiative (KI3) set out to strengthen the availability, access to, and utilization of implementation knowledge to accelerate progress in scaling up implementation and impact on nutrition. It was recognized that implementers need practical, curated, and hands-on implementation knowledge that is country specific and accounts for different social, political, and economic realities. In response to this need, KI3 systematically mapped the organizations and initiatives that already provide knowledge and tools on implementation for nutrition actions. The result was a database of entities that provide knowledge within the implementation science field. It includes 50 implementation knowledge providers, very few of which are physically based in low- and middle-income countries. To test the usefulness of the resources identified, we then piloted an approach to make them more accessible through the development of an online tools map. This pilot
tools map could then provide the basis for interested parties to build upon if further funding could be made available.",Open Access,,CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH),CGIAR Research Programs on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH),133952.pdf,133741,,,,,,2020-05-27,2020-06-23,Related blogpost https://a4nh.cgiar.org/2020/05/22/implementation-in-nutrition-a-tools-map/,"CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH). 2020.

216,"Rapid urbanization in Africa south of the Sahara continues to highlight the importance of informal retailers as a source of both food and employment for the urban poor. The most recent Africa Agriculture Status Report emphasizes that, due to demographic and socioeconomic transformation in the region, the center of gravity of Africa’s food system is shifting to urban areas (AGRA, 2020). Informal retailers—including those who vend in open-air wet markets and hawk on pavements and streets—provide a critical link between agricultural producers and consumers. While the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the vulnerability of this constituency (Resnick et al., 2020), informal traders have long been victims of other public health, economic, and climate shocks (Battersby & Watson, 2019). To build the resilience of informal traders and enhance their contributions to urban food security, fundamental governance issues need to be addressed. This brief synthesizes research on informal traders conducted under the “Economywide Factors Affecting Agricultural Growth and Rural Transformation” flagship of the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM) led by IFPRI. The research spanned Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, and Zambia and involved comparative analysis across capital cities based on media events data, surveys with traders, and interviews with urban bureaucrats. In this way, traders’ experiences could be complemented with policymakers’ insights about bottlenecks and opportunities for reform",Open Access,,"Resnick, Danielle","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",134322.pdf,134126,,"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

218,"Onion is a common vegetable crop used globally as seasoning and for medicinal purposes (van der Meer 1997; Cheema et al. 2003). The bulb is also used widely in Ghana in the preparation of stews and soups, accounting for around one-fifth of vegetable expenditure by households (van Asselt et al. 2018). Despite being widely consumed, onion production in Ghana falls well short of demand with imports coming in from neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso even during the peak local production season. Although trade statistics are notoriously weak, some estimates suggest as much as 80 to 90 percent of onion in the local market is imported. The two main varieties cultivated in Ghana are Bawku Red and Galmi. Major production challenges include varietal issues, the seasonal nature of production, and high post-harvest losses. The importance of onion and the significant potential for growth in the subsector has long since been recognized, and the crop was one of the first to be prioritized under Ghana’s Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) program.",Open Access,,"Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA)

220,"Soya bean is an important legume that is both a valuable source of feed for livestock and fish and a good source of protein in human diets. The bean contains around 30 percent cholesterol free oil, 40 percent protein, and essential vitamins (El Agroudy et al. 2011). The soya bean industry provides numerous opportunities for value chain actors from seed and grain production through to processing and marketing. As such, growth and modernization of the soya bean sector has potential to improve livelihoods and reduce poverty. While industrial processing and utilization of soya bean has expanded in Ghana, domestic production has not kept up with demand, resulting in significant growth in imports. Currently around half of soya beans or soya bean products is imported (Eshun et al. 2018; Gage et al. 2012). Average soya bean crop yields are low, ranging from 0.7 to 1.7 metric tons per hectare depending on variety, the environment, and management practices used (SRID 2017).",Open Access,,"Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA)

Efforts to enhance seed security should be inclusive, without disparities related to in-come, social class, age, or gender.

222,"The UN Sustainable Development Goals were established to build a better and more sustainable future for all. Progress toward development objectives has been uneven over time, and the disadvantaged tend to suffer disproportionately, particularly in times of severe shocks or crises like the COVID-19 global pandemic. The inclusion of the phrase “for all” is a good reminder that meeting our global goals will require paying particular attention to equity and ensuring no one is left behind. To consider equity, one must acknowledge that not everyone starts from the same set of circumstances, and assess how unfair, unjust, and exclusionary social and political processes have created that situation. Addressing inequity involves being mindful of those processes and removing barriers that prevent people from participating fully in decisions that determine how goods, opportunities, or resources are distributed. It is subtly, yet importantly, different from equality, which involves ensuring those goods, opportunities, or resources are divided equally among a group. In order to work toward equality, one must ensure equity has been achieved.",Open Access,,"Malapit, Hazel J.

224,"Irish potato is the second most important food crop in Kenya after maize (Kaguongo et al., 2014). Potato production in Kenya is expected to grow, as farmers are being encouraged both by climate shifts and by the government to diversify their production from reliance on maize. Many farmers are opting to grow potato because it is fast-maturing compared to maize and can be used to bridge the gap during shortages of the staple grain (ibid). However, significant barriers exist to more productive and profitable potato cultivation in East Africa, including low quality of seed potato, poor disease and soil fertility management, and high rates of post-harvest losses (SchulteGeldermann, 2013). Average potato yields in Nyandarua County are 3-4 tonnes per acre per season, well below the 10 tonnes per hectare that can be realised by professional farmers using certified seed and sound agricultural practices (Kaguongo et al., 2014).",Open Access,,"Scollard, Phoebe

229,"Investments in adolescent health have the potential to influence the future course of global health by improving the health and nutritional status of adolescents themselves, their life trajectories in adulthood, and the lives of their future children (1,2). Despite the growing recognition of the importance of adolescent health and nutrition (1–6), very few policies and programs have been designed and imple-mented to improve adolescent nutrition especially in low- and middle-income countries. There is also little evidence on how to effectively address the health and nutrition needs of adolescents from well-designed program effectiveness studies. Having a clear understanding of the nutritional problems of adolescents, and the drivers of those problems are prerequisites to developing appropriate policies and programs to improve adolescent nutrition, health and well-being. This brief offers a concise overview of the key nutritional challenges among Indonesian adolescents and current policies and programs to address these challenges. It also highlights other programs and policies to consider based on regional and international experiences.",Open Access,,"Go, Ara

234,"International trade of food and agricultural products plays a major role in ensuring food security and livelihoods across the African continent. Yet formal intracontinental trade data give only a glimpse of trade’s importance for African consumers and producers because—depending on the country and border—up to 99 percent of agricultural trade crosses borders informally. In West Africa, for example, an estimated 30 percent of staple foods evade formal customs, and the proportion can be much greater for highly perishable fruits and vegetables. Consequently, formal trade data paint only a limited picture of COVID-19’s disruptive effect on trade within the African continent—and of related nutrition and livelihood consequences. To better understand the current and future impacts on African food producers and consumers, we must examine both the magnitude and unique mechanisms of informal cross-border trade (ICBT).",Open Access,,"Bouët, Antoine

235,"In the past decade, Ghana has seen a significant reduction in stunting among children under five years of age. However, anemia only declined marginally over the same period, with the result that the rate of child anemia continues to be a severe public health emergency. These changes occurred within a socioeconomic context considered favorable for nutrition outcomes, marked by expansion and diversification of the economy, and investments in key infrastructure, healthcare, education, and water and sanitation. The Stories of Change in Nutrition study in Ghana aimed to better understand the changes in stunting and anemia between 2009 and 2018, as well as the potential drivers of these changes. Such findings can be used to inform agendasetting, implementation of existing policies, and future planning at national and subnational levels in Ghana. This study’s findings are important because both stunting and anemia are linked to significant adverse health and well-being impacts, particularly in low-income settings [1], and are listed among the global targets for nutrition for 2025 agreed by national ministers of health (including Ghana’s) at the World Health Assembly.",Open Access,,"Aryeetey, Richmond

236,"In Ethiopia, as in much of sub-Saharan Africa, the first known case of coronavirus arrived in mid-March (on March 13, 2020), weeks after the pandemic had spread rapidly in parts of Europe and the United States. The government swiftly imposed restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, closing schools (on March 16, 2020), limiting travel and encouraging people to remain at home. Such restrictions were needed to keep the pandemic from overwhelming a healthcare system with limited capacity to respond to an infectious disease outbreak. Only limited information is available about the effect of these restrictions on economic activity, food security and livelihoods in Ethiopia. A survey of residents of Addis Ababa conducted in May 2020 found that more than half of households reported lower-than-expected incomes and more than one third were extremely stressed about the situation. These results further showed that poorer households were more severely affected, although the food security situation in Addis, while declining, was not yet dire.",Open Access,,"Alderman, Harold

237,"According to the United Nations, the world’s population will grow by 2 billion people over the coming decades to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 (UNDESA-DP 2019a). The dignity and life prospects of those additional 2 billion people will depend on their ability to meet basic needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter, and their access to adequate employment. The most pressing need for jobs will be felt in those regions and countries that have not yet gone through the demographic transition, and where the cohort of young people is growing rapidly. The challenge will be compounded by an increasingly crowded, more competitive world with fewer natural resources per capita, and by the threat of climate change, which is projected to affect every sector of the economy (Arent 2014).",Open Access,,"Cenacchi, Nicola

239,"Agriculture holds tremendous potential to improve nutrition. Traditionally, agriculture investments focused on producing enough food to allow people to meet their caloric needs and on generating employment and income. In the last decade, the understanding of how agriculture can contribute to nutrition has shifted from the implicit assumption that increased productivity and income would automatically improve nutrition to the acknowledgement that explicit nutrition goals and actions are needed to improve nutritional outcomes (1–4). This has led to increased commitments and investments in nutrition-sensitive agriculture programs and accompanying research to study these programs’ impact on nutrition outcomes. Guidance on how to make agriculture more nutrition-sensitive was also developed and included recommendations to target the first 1,000 days of a child’s life (from conception to 2 years of age) and to focus on reducing stunting (5–7). These developments coincided with the global commitment to achieve the World Health Assembly target of reducing child stunting by 40 percent by 2025 (8).",Open Access,,"Leroy, Jef L.

240,"Human health is a fundamental feature of sustainable agricultural intensification. Agricultural intensification that increases the burden of human disease, however environmentally benign, is not sustainable. Conversely, sustainable agricultural methods provide specific opportunities for improving human health. The intensification of food systems in low- and middle income countries (LMIC), as they transition from subsistence to market-oriented production, is typically associated with human health risks. Some health risks are associated with the initial stages of intensification, for example, concentration of livestock production and animal waste in peri-urban areas. Inputs associated with this intensification, including fertilizers, pesticides, and antibiotics, can have negative effects on farmers’ health, clean water, and resistance in pathogens and vectors. In rapidly intensifying agricultural systems, regulatory processes that limit the use of harmful products and their residues in water and food may not be in place. Therefore, LMIC face a particular challenge to “de-risk” agricultural intensification, through technical and policy-related interventions that reduce health risks in transitioning agricultural systems.",Open Access,,"Lines, Jo

241,"Food systems, which are essential sources of food, but also of income and employment, especially for resource-poor populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), are undergoing dramatic transformations. Driven by changes in diets, urbanization, longer supply chains, and new ways of purchasing and consuming foods, these transformations pose serious challenges to achieving healthy, environmentally sustainable, and inclusive food systems for all. Rates of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are still stubbornly high, while overweight, obesity, and accompanying noncommunicable diseases are rising — with these multiple forms of malnutrition increasingly found within the same communities, households, or even individuals.",Open Access,,"Béné, Christophe

244,"This research examines the effects of an intervention aimed at reducing Post-Harvest Losses (PHL) of maize growing farmers during their maize storage in Tanzania. Farmers were invited to attend a training on best practices in post-harvest maize management, and a randomized subset of trainees received the opportunity to buy an improved storage facility (silos) at a substantially discounted price. Data collected at 30 days and 90 days after harvest, however, do not point to significant impacts of the treatments offered to the farmers. Receiving training on best practices improved stated knowledge but training nor the opportunity to purchase an improved storage had a significant effect on maize storage and sales behavior, physical PHL during storage, or the quality of the stored maize. The research explores potential explanations and provides some policy recommendations for future learning and decision-making on how to address PHL issues in developing countries.",Open Access,,"Vandercasteelen, Joachim

At just 0.06 percent in 2017, the country’s agricultural research intensity ratio (that is, spending as a share of AgGDP) is one of the lowest in the world. The number of agricultural researchers has grown steadily over time, as has the average qualification level of researchers. The majority of researchers are crop scientists, however, leaving other important areas (notably livestock and fisheries) severely underresearched.

252,"West Africa is expected to suffer yield and production losses of staple crops under climate change, with more severe yield reductions occurring in the period between 2030 and 2050 (Ittersum et al., 2016). In addition, extreme events, including droughts and floods, are expected to become more frequent under climate change, also potentially affecting yields (Abiodun, Lawal, Salami, & Abatan, 2013). Internal displacement and natural resource conflicts are another expected climate impact, as are pest and disease outbreaks (Gregory, Johnson, Newton, & Ingram, 2009; Obioha, 2008). Given these potentially serious climate impacts, a team comprising researchers from Michigan State University and Nigerian partner universities conducted studies intended to inform Nigerian agricultural policy around climate adaptation.

254,"Understanding the context-specific causes of child malnutrition, including those related to political commitment and program and policy coherence, is essential for effectively reducing the prevalence of nutrition-related problems such as stunting and anemia and their subsequent negative impacts on human and national development. Between 2005 and 2015 Rwanda made substantial progress in reducing malnutrition, reducing stunting and anemia among children < 5 years of age by 14 and 15 percentage points, respectively. Despite these improvements, stunting and anemia remain important nutrition issues for young children in Rwanda with the prevalence of stunting (38%) among the highest in the world [8]. Furthermore, stunting reduction has varied across the country with some districts experiencing declines in stunting (“reduced stunting districts”), while in others stunting has either increased or stayed the same (“non-reduced stunting districts”). To facilitate greater progress in reducing child malnutrition in Rwanda, we conducted a Stories of Change Study which aimed to document the drivers of stunting and anemia reduction in Rwanda, understand what may have contributed to the variation in stunting reduction across districts, and to understand the remaining nutrition problems and the potential barriers and facilitators to future progress. The overall goal is for these results to be used by program implementers and policymakers to refine programs and policies to further reduce child malnutrition in Rwanda. This study was modeled after similar studies conducted in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Odisha (India), Nepal, Senegal, and Zambia under the Stories of Change in Nutrition project.",Open Access,,"Iruhiriye, Elyse

258,"Multisectoral coordination and action are recognized as necessary conditions to effec-tively address the multiple drivers of malnutrition. There has been a strong effort in the past decade to establish multisector coordination at the national level among member states of the Scaling Up Nutrition Movement. However, the practice of subnational and commu-nity-level nutrition coordination is still emerging, and literature on the factors related to the formation and success of such coordination bodies is limited (for example, Harris et al. 2017). Understanding contextual factors is particularly important for supporting local-level ena-bling environments, where traditional customs may hold influence over political and social structures. A multisector nutrition committee was formed in Poyentanga, a subdistrict of Wa West District in the impoverished Upper West region of Ghana, where acute child malnutrition is driven by seasonal food insecurity. The committee was launched in November 2018 as a plat-form to coordinate local stakeholders to address the challenges of persistent malnutrition in the communities of Poyentanga. This case study examines the enabling environment for local-level engagement and action on nutrition to understand the context and the key factors that led to the formation of the Poyentanga nutrition committee. The basic policy framework and institutional structures were already in place for multi-sector coordination on nutrition before the committee was established. The National Nutrition Policy specifies the formation of a multisectoral coordination mechanism for nutrition services and programmes at national and subnational levels, and responsibility for resource allocation for the delivery of necessary services sits with the District Assemblies. Yet a strong focus on the treatment of acute malnutrition in Wa West District had left the administration of curative nu-trition services largely to the health sector, with little attention given to preventative ap-proaches or engagement from other sectors. Once attention was drawn to the prevalence and consequences of malnutrition, stakeholders from across sectors demonstrated high commit-ment to addressing the problem.",Open Access,,"Billings, Lucy

261,"Traceability is the ability to track a product through all stages of production, processing and distribution (including importation and at retail). In the context of horticultural produce, if consumers become ill from the food they have eaten, or food is found to contain a harmful chemical, traceability allows this food to be traced from the shop where it was purchased, to the trader who delivered it, to the factory that processed or packed it, and ultimately to the farm where it was grown. In this way, the source of the problem can be identified, and corrective action can be taken [1]. While traceability does not itself guarantee food safety, it is considered a fundamental component of modern food safety systems. 
In traceability systems, it is good practice to use unique codes to identify blocks of land, individual farms, farmer groups, intermediaries, packers and processors. Each crate of carrots, for example, has its own unique code. By entering this code into a database, one can see on which parcels of land the carrots were grown.",Open Access,,"Hoffmann, Vivian

262,"This brief presents descriptive information and prelimi-nary results from an impact evaluation of the second phase of the Innovation for Agribusiness (InovAgro II) project interventions in northern Mozambique. InovAgro II is a development program intended to decrease rural poverty by improving the connectedness of farmers to market systems. The InovAgro project is funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and implemented by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) in partnership with COWI1. The InovAgro project operates in 11 districts—namely Mocuba, Ile, Namarroi, Molumbo, Gurúe and Alto Molócue in Zambézia prov-ince; Malema, Ribáuè and Erati in Nampula province; and Namuno and Chiúre in Cabo Delgado province. In-dependent impact evaluation of the project, funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), is being implemented by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) using primary data coming from two InovAgro-focus districts in Zambézia prov-ince (Alto Molócue and Molumbo) focusing on three of the five targeted value chain crops by the InovAgro project, namely: soybean, pigeon pea and maize.",Open Access,,"Ghebru, Hosaena

264,The current agricultural strategy of the Federal Government of Nigeria—the Agricultural Promotion Policy 2016-2020—carries forward the revitalization of the agricultural sector as outlined in the preceding strategy—the Agricultural Transformation Agenda 2011-2016. The Agricultural Promotion Policy aims to increase agricultural production to meet the food needs of the country’s rapidly growing population and transform agriculture from subsistence to commercial and export-oriented production. The complementary Agricultural Sector Food Security and Nutrition Strategy 2016-2025 declares improved food security and nutrition as main goals of the intended agricultural transformation and identifies priority areas that should guide the activities of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) and aligned stakeholders to achieve these objectives. Both strategy documents emphasize the importance of policy-relevant and rigorous agricultural and nutrition research to inform policy priority setting and support decision-making processes. This policy note summarizes findings from a recent study by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) researchers that seeks to inform Nigerian policymakers and donors about the effects of agricultural transformation on food and nutrition security of farm households in Nigeria (Ecker et al 2018).,Open Access,,"Ecker, Olivier

265,"Mechanization increases the power applied to agricultural operations and is one tool among many for improving farm productivity and increasing incomes for Nigeria’s farmers and processors. It alone cannot drive the transformation of agriculture (Pingali 2007). Farmers will mechanize to lower costs and ensure timeliness of operations, allowing a greater area of land to be cultivated. The demand for mechanization is therefore determined by the stage of agricultural transformation reflecting the use of complementary inputs (improved seeds, fertilizer), the intensity of farming, land holdings, and rural labor supply and thus wages. Countries across the developing world have mechanized at different rates corresponding to their level of agricultural transformation but also strongly influenced by government policies. Assessments of agricultural mechanization at the continental level have found that Nigeria has an agricultural sector characterized by both low productivity growth and low machinery growth relative to other African countries (2018, Malabo Montpellier Panel). This brief will examine some of the supply and demand side constraints that may be hindering the adoption of mechanization and outline strategies where government and donors can focus their efforts to better support farm productivity.",Open Access,,"Takeshima, Hiroyuki

266,"Over the last decade, land tenure reform and enhanced tenure security have been given greater attention by African governments, including Nigeria, as policy tools to encourage agricultural growth and to alleviate poverty. Land tenure security can generate agricultural investment incentives and lead to increased agricultural productivity through three channels (Besely 1995). First, it promotes long term investment in land by reducing expropriation risk. Second, it encourages investment by lowering transaction costs and allowing more productive farmers to purchase or rent land from less productive farmers, making both parties better off. Third, it reduces asymmetric information about land ownership rights, allowing individuals to use their land as collateral for loans encouraging investment. Less than 3 percent of the land in Nigeria is formally registered leaving the vast majority of the population to deal with tenure insecurity and its attendant negative implications on land related investment and agricultural productivity. This brief will examine current land policy and administration in Nigeria, landholders demand for tenure security, and present recommendations to improve administration of land.",Open Access,,"Ghebru, Hosaena

271,"An analysis of learning outcomes from the evaluation of a national school feeding program in Ghana reveals that disadvantaged students benefited most from free school meals. Overall, students with access to school meals had higher academic and cognitive test scores on average compared with students without access to the program, but the program led to much greater gains for certain disadvantaged groups including girls, students from poor households, and students from the Northern regions of Ghana. This evidence suggests that providing free school meals is an effective way to increase opportunities for disadvantaged youth by leveling the playing field through improved educational achievement. However, key structural changes could maximize potential learning impacts resulting from the program. Improvements in program implementation through monitoring the quality and quantity of food served are needed to overcome program implementation challenges identified by the evaluation. Beyond the feeding program itself, investments to improve the quality of education are expected to further improve learning outcomes, especially when school meals incentivize increased school attendance.",Open Access,,"Gelli, Aulo

Based on the full report, this brief summarizes lessons learned from the Food Security Policy Innovation Lab’s capacity strengthening efforts over the 2013-2018 period and from related capacity development initiatives conducted over the last four decades by the partner institutions in Africa and Asia. “Capacity” is defined as the resources required for people and institutions to reach their objectives and achieve results in an efficient and sustainable manner. Capacity development is therefore the process of enhancing, improving, and unleashing such resources – in people, organizations, and systems. In this report, the term “locally led” refers to institutions registered in the host country, led by nationals of the host-country and often, but not necessarily, affiliated with a public university or government unit in the host country.",Open Access,,"Jayne, Thomas S.

273,"Since 2013, the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Security Policy (FSP) has combined multidisciplinary research on emergent issues facing food systems with policy analysis to provide an enabling environment for improved food security. Supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), FSP is implemented through a consortium of three research institutions: Michigan State University (MSU), the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the University of Pretoria. These policy research institutions, together with local institutions, have provided data and analysis that national and subnational governments and regional bodies can use to generate informed policies around food and food security. This engagement has involved supporting national governments’ and regional organizations’ agri-food system–related policy processes with evidence generated through applied research on food systems. This evidence enabled participants in those processes to consider the merits of various policy options with a stronger conceptual and applied understanding of the issues at stake. As outlined in Box 1, FSP efforts targeted five main activity areas, with a regional emphasis on Africa and Asia.",Open Access,,"Resnick, Danielle

274,"Sub-Saharan Africa is witnessing rapid changes in farm size distributions. “Medium-scale” farm landholdings of five to 100 hectares now account for a substantial and growing share of farmland in many African countries. 1 Since 2000, this category of African farmer has acquired more land and put much more new land under cultivation than large-scale foreign investors. In parallel to these developments, the region is witnessing changes in land tenure institutions that influence who is acquiring land (Ghebru and Girmachew, 2019a; 2019b). Parts of the region are experiencing a notable shift in the allocation of customary land from a rights-based approach that secures access to land for localborn members of the community to market-based approaches to land allocation based increasingly on willingness to pay. As population densities rise and land becomes scarce in many areas, tenure security is becoming increasingly important. Research evidence shows that security of tenure typically promotes long-term land investments and agricultural productivity, hence the need for African governments to focus on improving land tenure security to more effectively achieve their national agricultural policy objectives.",Open Access,,"Jayne, Thomas S.

275,"Trade tensions between the major world economies increased in 2018, and US tariff increases triggered reprisals and counter-reprisals. In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), trade tensions between the US and China and other US trade partners are expected to generate a mix of opportunities and threats for exporters of food products. To better understand the likely impacts of global trade tensions for LAC, we modeled a set of four scenarios using the MIRAGRODEP model1. We looked at impacts on exports, imports, production, GDP, household consumption, and adjustment costs through changes in labor markets up to 2030.

277,"Many governments intervene in agricultural markets. The reasons for doing so vary greatly: to keep food prices low for consumers; to support farm incomes; to reduce price volatility; and to meet other political objectives. Some policy interventions can have unforeseen consequences. Monitoring the levels of incentives in many countries provides information on changes in global markets, and measuring the impact of incentives helps governments to make necessary policy adjustments. Several international organizations have for some time been regularly monitoring agricultural incentives, but in an uncoordinated way. “Historically, global information and data on incentives for agricultural production have been widely scattered and not comparable,” says David Laborde, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). To address these issues, a group of leading international organizations joined with IFPRI and PIM in 2013 to form the Agricultural Incentives Consortium (Ag-Incentives). Ag-Incentives brings together data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the World Bank.

278,"Egypt has been providing cash to poor households through its first conditional cash transfer program, Takaful and Karama, a social protection program run by the Ministry of Social Solidarity (MoSS), since March 2015. Takaful (“Solidarity”) supports poor families with children under 18, while Karama (“Dignity”) supports the elderly poor and people living with disabilities. The cash transfer program has enrolled 2.25 million families across all of Egypt’s governorates. The amount of the Takaful cash transfer provided to households depends on the number of children and their school level. The Karama program provides a set amount per individual. In order to reach the poorest households, participants are selected using a proxy means test. In the Takaful program, 89 percent of recipients are women, while only 11 percent are men. Beginning in 2018, Takaful will also begin implementing conditionalities, requiring households in the program to ensure their children attend school and participate in health screenings, added to antenatal care for pregnant women and post-natal care. The Takaful and Karama program was evaluated by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) using both quantitative statistical methods (simple questions asked to many households during a survey) and qualitative methods (more in-depth questions asked to fewer households in longer interviews). The evaluation was designed to measure and explain the impacts of the cash transfers on household welfare, and to examine whether the program’s criteria for household selection were effective in identifying poor households. This brief, which focuses on the Takaful component of the program, summarizes the main findings from the evaluation and key recommendations.",Open Access,,"Breisinger, Clemens

Initially this was done on a relatively small and ad-hoc basis in Bangladesh (1992–94), Pakistan (1985–86), Malawi (1989–94), and Mozambique (1996–99), but in 2003 IFPRI began establishing country-based teams to support the development of broader policies and national strategies related to agriculture, food, and poverty. These teams worked in newly opened country program offices in Africa south of the Sahara (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Uganda) as well as in Bangladesh, China, Costa Rica, India, and Pakistan.",Open Access,,"Hazell, Peter B.R.

282,"Given the central role that agriculture plays in the rural economy of Africa, several countries have implemented supply– and demand-driven policies and programs to promote sustainable fertilizer use, with mixed results. However, not much has been said about the market structure or competitive behavior along the supply chain in the highly concentrated fertilizer industry, nor about how this affects fertilizer uptake in the region. Globally, the industry has only a few producers, and African countries are highly and increasingly dependent on imported fertilizer. Locally, fertilizer distribution channels are also characterized by a limited number of market actors, often with a poor dealer network.",Open Access,,"Hernandez, Manuel A.

287,"Armed conflict combined with prolonged drought has put about 20 million people at risk of starvation and death in Somalia, South Sudan, Yemen, and northern Nigeria. The international development and aid communities are caught between the enormity of the humanitarian crisis, which demands an estimated US$4.4 billion to address, and the lack of resources forthcoming from donors. Food crises, famine-like conditions, and famines recur with regularity in many developing countries (see Box 1 for definitions of terms). Although the current famines can be largely attributed to conflicts, chronic food insecurity also threatens several other African countries. For example, 6.7 million people were affected by Malawi’s largest food crisis in decades in 2016–2017, and the country remains vulnerable to weather extremes that could create food emergencies (World Bank 2017). In Kenya, food security has deteriorated since the end of 2016 and half of its 47 counties face food shortages (Chatterjee and Mengistu 2017). How do countries prepare to prevent shocks—natural and man-made—from generating food crises? What does it take to break the cycle of chronic food insecurity and build resilient food systems? How have some countries managed to prevent drought from leading to famine? In this brief, we document lessons for building resilient food systems to prevent future famines.",Open Access,,"Babu, Suresh Chandra

288,"The brief presents several policy recommendations to help prevent conflict and to address some of the underlying causes of forced migration: 
• Build resilience to conflict and other shocks. Early warning systems and social protection programs should be strengthened to help policymakers and populations respond to and mitigate the impact of shocks like rising food prices, losses in agricultural livelihoods, and negative weather events like drought. 
• Support local agricultural and food economies and markets. This will help rural populations recover after a conflict. Investments in agricultural and rural development play an important role in both preventing and recovering from conflicts. Ensuring that marginalized populations—including women, smallholder farmers, and minority groups—are equitably included in such investments, as well as in the distribution of natural resources, is key in reducing the tensions that often lead to conflict and forced migration.
• Let migrant populations work. Neighboring countries that become hosts to refugee populations also have an important role to play in reducing forced migration. Allowing migrants to work both reduces the economic burden on the host country and allows migrants to generate income that they can then bring back to their home countries when and if they return. This can help countries recover more quickly from conflicts.",Open Access,,"da Silva, José Graziano

Knowledge that is practically useful needs to encompass a lot more than data and evidence – it needs to include experience. To meet this growing demand for experiential learning, Transform Nutrition developed the Stories of Change (SoC) initiative. The goal was to systematically assess and analyse drivers of change in six high-burden countries – Bangladesh, India (Odisha), Ethiopia, Nepal, Senegal, and Zambia – that have had some success in accelerating improvements in nutrition. From 2014–16, country teams undertook analysis of changes over time in nutrition outcomes, in nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive drivers, and changes in nutrition-relevant policies and programs.

292,"This study reveals that aquaculture is more profitable for fish farmers than crop farming, and generates large income spillovers for the local economy, thus presenting important opportunities for rural growth. Furthermore, small-scale fish farms, while currently somewhat less productive than large farms overall, generate larger indirect spillover effects per acre of land. Viewed through an economywide lens, small-scale aquaculture has substantial potential to support smallholder livelihoods whilst creating large income spillovers that principally benefit landless households and raise rural incomes. These findings imply that any aquaculture development strategy should focus on fish farms under 10 acre in size, rather than the large-scale farm development prioritized in the past. First, small-scale farmers should be empowered to use their ponds with maximum efficiency by, for instance, facilitating access to sources of credit and information. Second, regulations should be revised to allo",Open Access,,"Filipski, Mateusz J.

294,"This report outlines recent (2007-2017) changes in agricultural practices for the main field crops grown in Myanmar’s Dry Zone, based on information gathered from the Rural Economy and Agriculture Dry Zone (READZ) survey. Myanmar’s Dry Zone is a vast area in the North-Central part of the country, spanning three different regions (Sagaing, Mandalay and Magway) and including the country’s second-largest city of Mandalay. The survey was carried out in April of 2017 in the townships of Budalin, Myittha, Magway and Pwintbyu. One objective of the survey was to assess trends in production patterns and practices for four of the major field crops grown in the area: rice, groundnut, sesame, and green gram. This was done by collecting recall data for three time periods: the year of the survey (2017, corresponding to the 2016-2017 growing season), five years prior (2012), and ten years prior (2007). Each farmer was asked only about their most important crop, so the results pertain not to all farmers growing a given crop, but rather to those specializing in each crop. This analysis allowed us to compare how production of the four major crops has evolved over the past ten years in terms of seasonality, technology and input use, and yields, and to identify evidence of any technological change and modernization occurring.",Open Access,,"Naing, Zaw Min",,132551.pdf,132341,,,,,,2018-03-16,2019-02-06,,"Naing, Zaw Min. 2017.

297,"Our study offers the following important findings relating to off-farm incomes in the Dry Zone: 1. Off-farm activities are a major source of income. Only 31% of Dry Zone income is generated directly from farming; off-farm self-employment is equally as important. Non-farm enterprises account for 20% of income, and remittances 15%. 2. Agriculture is central to rural employment. Fiftyeight percent of working-age individuals consider farming or agricultural labor to be their primary occupation, and agricultural labor is by far the most important secondary occupation. 3. Women and men work off-farm in similar numbers, but men earn higher wages. The gender wage gap is most pronounced in casual employment. There is less gender disparity in wages for non-farm work than for on-farm work. 58% of non-farm enterprises are run by women. 4. Non-farm enterprises are growing rapidly. Since 2011, the numbers of retail stores more than doubled, agricultural trading and processing trebled, and rental services providers more than quadrupled. Non-farm income is the most important source of startup capital for these businesses. 5. Most of businesses are self-operated microenterprises. The vast majority hire no labor. The rural non-farm economy is not yet a major provider of jobs, other than to business proprietors themselves.",Open Access,,"Zu, Aye Myint

300,"Sri Lanka continues to experience strong economic growth over the recent years. In the food and agriculture sector, however, there are several conspicuous policy changes that require attentive analysis. Also, since 2008, agriculture growth slowed down due to drought and weak global demand which affected exports and trade. This brief takes stock of key food and agricultural indicators and provides key recommendations to further expedite the transformation of the sector. Sri Lanka has come a long way in terms of agricultural transformation, moving from subsistence- based agrarian economy towards early integration stage. But further progress towards market- oriented industrialized agriculture will crucially depend on the policy, institutional, and technological innovations that are designed and implemented by the Government. The government of Sri Lanka has been pursuing large-scale reconstruction and development projects to achieve higher growth by developing small and medium enterprises and to increase agricultural productivity.",Open Access,,"Rao, P.

304,"Many developing countries seem likely to see a substantial downturn in economic growth over the 2015–2030 implementation period of the SDGs, compared with the recent years of strong growth. Since the 2015 WEO, the macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated further, with projected global growth for 2017 falling from 3.8 to 3.5 percent. However, a key result of this study is that projected declines in global poverty rates are not greatly affected by the anticipated slowdown in economic growth. Under the updated projections for 2030, the extreme poverty rate will be 5.2 percent compared to 4.8 percent. For most groups of countries and subgroups of populations, projected 2030 poverty rates will be within one percentage point of the levels projected under the optimistic outlook on global growth. However, there is some variation across countries, and even countries not directly affected by the recent global slowdown are likely to see long-term impacts. And despite this optimistic finding, we should be concerned that the movement in poverty rates is away from the SDG goal of complete elimination of poverty.",Open Access,,"Laborde Debucquet, David

The hope is that by identifying the factors which contributed to this positive change, the nutrition community can learn from the successes and challenges of Senegal’s story of change in nutrition. This brief summarises the findings from a research study – Stories of Change in Nutrition in Senegal – the aim of this study is to develop a story which helps to explain the interrelated factors that contributed to Senegal’s reduction in undernutrition.

This brief focuses on three overlapping ‘Stories of Change’: We first discuss the evolution of Ethiopia’s nutrition sensitive agendas within the agriculture, social protection, and health sectors over the past decade. The second story details the ongoing alignment of national nutrition agendas with the capacities to implement them at zone and woreda levels. The third story centres on the challenges communities face in engaging with nutrition programming in a changing, but increasingly limiting, environment. The objective of this brief is to draw attention to the real world challenges of implementing nutrition sensitive agendas and provide recommendations for how to move forward with nutrition sensitive programming.",Open Access,,"Warren, Andrea",CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH),130714.pdf,130564,,,,,,2016-08-16,2020-08-20,This work is funded by CIFF and DFID through Transform Nutrition,"Warren, Andrea. 2016.

309,"The government of Malawi is pursuing an export led agricultural growth strategy, and therefore improving transport quality between major urban areas, as well as between rural areas and ports of trade or market centers, is a key pri-ority (DTIS, 2014). For this reason, being able to assess travel distances, times, and costs for major commerce routes is an important first step. Despite this, there exists a lack of basic data relating to the geographic and economic as-pects of road travel in many of these countries. The purpose of this technical brief is to describe the procedure taken for the estimation of transportation costs for use in the development of a spatially disaggregated, market level model of the Malawian agricultural sector, which is being done as part of BioSight’s ongoing work on the sustainable intensi-fication of agriculture in Africa, south of the Sahara. Modelling exercises such as these require estimation of the mar-keting margins of agricultural inputs and outputs traded across regions. The transport cost makes up a significant component of the marketing margin. High quality data on transport costs is therefore crucial for the parameterization and application of market models such as these. This technical brief describes a procedure for estimating transport distances, times, and costs between three major urban areas in south, central, and north Malawi. The difficulties around obtaining reliable spatial data and how to use these to develop and assess specific transport routes are dis-cussed.",Open Access,,"Guo, Zhe

Partner engagement is a critical piece in moving policy research to outcomes, as is reflected in IFPRI’s most recent strategy and increased deployment of personnel to country programs. However, local deployment for impact comes at the expense of critical mass at headquarters and the ability to engage in emerging trends in scientific discovery. And, as the review highlights, such critical mass can only be deployed over a limited number of research themes. As the IFPRI STI team explores the next strategic focus for its research, it faces the difficult question of how to balance the increasing emphasis on accountability, and therefore impact, with the ability of IFPRI to define new research areas and generate IPGs in this critical policy area.",Open Access,,"Lynam, John K.","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",130527.pdf,130316,,,,,,2016-05-04,2021-08-17,"This brief is based on the Independent Impact Assessment Report No. 43, Balancing International Public Goods and Accountability: Exploring the Impact of IFPRI’s Policy Research on Science, Technology, and Innovation by John K.

In this brief, we present findings from the first survey in Myanmar to analyze the supply side of agricultural mechanization. We find evidence of rapid growth in the number, geographical distribution, and sales of agricultural machinery supply businesses. The range and value of machinery sold accelerated rapidly, especially post-2011 as the country opened economically.

318,"Agricultural mechanization is already well advanced in the village tracts surveyed, almost completely replacing the use of draft cattle. Economic reforms and the growth in the non-farm sector from 2011 have stimulated an ongoing process of structural transformation, in which labor is moving from agriculture to the more productive urban industrial and service sectors. Resultant rural labor shortages and increases in real wage rates have been major drivers of mechanization in agricultural sector, particularly from 2013 onwards. The declining real price of some types of machinery has contributed to the acceleration of this process. The increasing availability of financial services following reforms post-2011 is also likely to have accelerated the adoption of large-scale agricultural machinery, particularly from 2013 onwards. The rise of rental markets, especially for large-scale equipment (combine harvesters and four-wheel tractors), has further improved access to these machines for farmers with small and large landholdings alike.",Open Access,,"Win, Myat Thida

319,"Climate change is a significant and growing threat to food security—already affecting vulnerable populations in many developing countries, and expected to affect ever more people in more places, unless action is taken beginning today. Current scenarios for business-as-usual farming under climate change project growing food security challenges by 2050. Worst hit will be underdeveloped regions of the world where food insecurity is already a problem and populations are vulnerable to shocks (Rosegrant et al. 2014). Improvements in agricultural technology and management are expected to increase food security, but if we do not address climate change, climate-related losses in crop and livestock productivity will reduce those gains (Lobell and Gourdji 2012). In this challenging environment, countries will need to contend with shifts in which crops they can best produce, significant changes in global prices, and change in countries’ comparative advantages. New analytical tools that allow policy makers and decision makers to integrate data from the global to the local level offer an important opportunity for countries to identify the most effective ways to address climate change.

322,"Egypt faces two nutritional challenges. The first is the “growth-nutrition disconnect.” High economic growth has not been accompanied by reduction in chronic child malnutrition, at least throughout the 2000s. Instead, the prevalence of child stunting increased during this decade—an atypical trend for a country outside wartime. The second challenge is the simultaneous presence of chronic undernutrition and overnutrition (due to excess consumption of calories). This “double burden of malnutrition” exists not only at the national level but also within families and even individual children. Both challenges are exceptionally pronounced in Egypt compared to other developing countries.

324,"Structural transformation in Southeast Asia poses challenges to the regions' food security and inclusive agricultural growth agenda. Integration of agricultural markets within ASEAN is high on the policy agenda given the current pressure on moving towards the establishment of a common market. This process though, may prove unattainable unless appropriate policies and strategies are designed to defuse food security and rural poverty concerns among policymakers and stakeholders. An improvement in agricultural value chains' competitiveness is supportive of the broader effort towards achieving competitive ASEAN economies. Two fundamental concerns arise in this regard, though. First, regional supply chains in key crops are increasingly crossing borders raising fears among primary producing countries of a loss of sovereignty and of missed opportunities for domestic industrialization and value addition. Corn, rice, livestock, and vegetables sourced from Lao PDR and Cambodia and processed and retailed in Thailand and Vietnam for subsequent re-export outside ASEAN are an example in case. Second, farm diversification out of traditional staple crops may be at variance with national and/or rural food security strategies. For instance, modernization of rice and corn value chains in the Philippines and Indonesia have been at variance with governments' efforts to achieve self-sufficiency. Furthermore, with a growing urban population, food price shocks are perceived as a major threat by all countries in the region, leading to sub-optimal policy outcomes at the national and regional level. Yet, both concerns are in need of a re-examination given the rapid transformation of Asia's farming systems and urban consumption patterns, and the associated growing pressures for farm mechanization, downstream industrialization, diversification of rural livelihoods, and adoption of more stringent food safety and quality standards.",Open Access,,Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA),,134572.pdf,134363,,,,,,2021-04-15,2021-08-17,,"Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA). 2016.

Countries that are determined to make rapid advances in malnutrition reduction can do so, and the incentives to improve nutrition are strong. Good nutrition provides a vital foundation for human development, central to meeting our full potential. When nutrition status improves, it leads to a host of positive outcomes for individuals and families. Many more children will live to see their fifth birthdays, their growth will be less disrupted, and they will gain in height and weight. They will learn more in school because their brain function is not impaired. As a result of this positive early environment, as adults they will have better jobs and get ill less often.

Despite the crucial role land plays in human welfare and development, investments in sustainable land management are low, especially in developing countries. These findings come from the book, Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement—A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development, which examines the costs of land degradation and what needs to be done to reverse it. The book reveals the cost of land degradation in case studies for 12 countries, analyzes the drivers, and identifies strategies for sustainable land management. It focuses on two kinds of land degradation: long-term loss of value of land ecosystem services due to land use and cover change (LUCC) and the use of land-degrading management practices on cropland and grazing lands that do not undergo LUCC. Six major biomes that accounted for about 86 percent of global land area in 2001 are covered, including forest, shrub lands, grasslands, cropland, barren land, and woodlands. Thirty-three percent of grasslands, 25 percent of croplands, and 23 percent of forests experienced degradation over the last three decades.",Open Access,,"Nkonya, Ephraim M., ed.

In comparison, there are numerous quantitative impact assessment studies of technology research, thus creating an imbalance of evidence for decisionmakers interested in investing in agricultural research. There are many reasons for this, but one has been the challenges in PORIA, notably in methods to assess attribution of policy outcomes to research and the measurement of impacts of policy outcomes. To respond to this, a workshop was convened from November 12-14, 2014 at IFPRI headquarters in Washington, DC. It was cosponsored by IFPRI; the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM); and the Standing Panel on Impact Assessment (SPIA) of the CGIAR’s Independent Science and Partnership Council (ISPC).",Open Access,,"Place, Frank

HVA is defined to include perishable agricultural commodities produced for the market that yield high returns to land, labor, or both. IFPRI’s research on HVA has been housed mainly in GRP27 (Participation in high value agricultural markets). Questions for the study included whether IFPRI had the right research strategy for this topic; was focused on the right issues; was a leader in the field; used the most relevant approaches and methods; and was successful in sensitizing/influ-encing the policies of governments, agribusiness, academia, civil society, and the international donor community. Finally, what has been the impact of the HVA policies that IFPRI influenced?",Open Access,,"Kydd, Jonathon","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)",129473.pdf,129262,,,,,,2015-06-26,2021-08-18,,"Kydd, Jonathon. 2014.

332,"The 2015 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report—the tenth in an annual series—presents a multidimensional measure of national, regional, and global hunger. It shows that the world has made progress in reducing hunger since 2000, but still has a long way to go, with levels of hunger still serious or alarming in 52 countries. The theme of this year’s report is armed conflict and the challenge of hunger. Conflict and hunger are closely associated. Indeed, conflict is the main cause of persistent severe hunger, and countries with the lowest levels of food security are often engaged in or recently emerged from war. Although conflict and hunger often travel hand in hand, history has shown that hunger need not result from conflict.",Open Access,Linked Open Data http://data.ifpri.org/lod/ghi  Standard Dataset http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/JL16EW,"von Grebmer, Klaus

333,Fish farming (aquaculture) is important to Myanmar’s food security and is developing and transforming quickly. This brief presents findings from a new field survey of the farmed fish value chain that is more detailed and broader than any previous study conducted in Myanmar. Many of our findings are at odds with what we perceive as conventional wisdom about fish farming in Myanmar. The findings have important policy implications to unlock the sector’s full growth potential and food security contributions.,Open Access,,"Belton, Ben

335,"As the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) celebrates its 40th anniversary, it is an appropriate time for the Institute and its key stakeholders to take stock of what is known about its policy influence and impact over the years. Has IFPRI been a worthwhile undertaking? What does available evidence tell us about how IFPRI might achieve even greater policy influence and impact in the future? This brief draws on a forthcoming paper1 that uses external sources of evidence to address these questions, including citations data, external program and management reviews commissioned by CGIAR, and a series of independently conducted impact assessment studies of many of IFPRI’s research programs and projects. While this body of evidence lacks scientific rigor, it does reflect the views of external experts based on careful study of the available evidence",Open Access,,"Hazell, Peter B. R.

336,"As we move into the post-2015 era of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the world faces many seemingly intractable problems. Malnutrition should not be one of them. The incentives to improve nutrition are strong, and determined countries can make rapid advances in malnutrition reduction. Good nutrition provides a vital foundation for human development that is central to meeting our full potential. When nutrition status improves, it leads to a host of positive outcomes for individuals and families. Improved nutrition worldwide means many more children will live past the age of five, their growth will be less disrupted, and they will gain in height and weight. Their cognitive abilities will develop more fully, allowing them to learn more both within and outside of school. As a result of sufficient nourishment and a positive early environment, children are more likely to get better jobs and fewer illnesses as adults—aging healthily and living longer.",Open Access,,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH),129991.pdf,129780,,,,,,2015-11-06,2021-08-17,,"International Food Policy Research Institute. 2015.

369,"Biofortified crops as sources of vitamin A contain provitamin A carotenoids, which are a precursor of vitamin A, similar to those found in some plant foods like carrots, mangos, and papaya. Two important factors to consider in the provitamin A crops are retention and bioavailability. The bioavailability of the most common plant provitamin A (beta-carotene) varies widely in relation to the food crop, genotype, cooking method, individual genetic factors, and consumption of fat with the meal. Bioconversion of dietary beta-carotene to retinol across plant foods ranges from 3 to 28:1 by weight (1). Food carotenoid degradation displays exponential decay patterns during storage and varies with the food matrix, crop genotype, and form of storage. It increases directly with time and temperature during storage as well as with exposure to high temperature, light, acids, and oxygen during processing. Because the bioconversion of provitamin A carotenoids to vitamin A is homeostatically regulated, excess toxic accumulation of retinol is prevented. Described below are the studies on retention, bioavailability and the efficacy trials conducted to date on biofortified provitamin A crops.",Open Access,,"De Moura, Fabiana F.",CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH),128500.pdf,128289,,,,,,2014-09-11,2021-08-24,,"De Moura, Fabiana F. 2014.

377,"The 2014 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report—the ninth in an annual series—presents a multidimensional measure of national, regional, and global hunger. It shows that the world has made progress in reducing hunger since 1990, but still has far to go, with levels of hunger remaining “alarming” or “extremely alarming” in 16 countries. This year’s report focuses on a critical aspect of hunger that is often overlooked: hidden hunger. Also known as micronutrient deficiency, hidden hunger affects more than an estimated 2 billion people globally. The repercussions of these vitamin and mineral deficiencies are both serious and long-lasting. Where hidden hunger has taken root, it not only prevents people from surviving and thriving as productive members of society, it also holds countries back in a cycle of poor nutrition, poor health, lost productivity, persistent poverty, and reduced economic growth.",Open Access,http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/27557,"von Grebmer, Klaus

378,"Feeding the world in the decades leading up to 2050—decades that will see an increase in food demand spurred by population and income growth and stronger impacts of climate change on agriculture—will require increased and more sustainable agricultural production. To determine how to achieve such production, the authors of the study Food Security in a World of Natural Resource Scarcity used a groundbreaking modeling approach to assess the yield and food security impacts of a broad range of agricultural technologies under varying assumptions regarding climate change and technology adoption. Their approach combines process-based crop modeling of agricultural technologies with sophisticated global food demand, supply, and trade modeling. The authors’ focus was on the world’s three key staple crops: maize, rice, and wheat.",Open Access,,"Rosegrant, Mark W.

380,"Women play important and varied roles in agriculture, but they have unequal access, relative to men, to productive resources and opportunities. Closing these gender gaps would be good both for women and for agriculture. This was the message given by The State of Food and Agriculture 2010-11, a report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). As it prepared the report, the FAO drew together a wealth of background information based on a growing body of research and statistics on women in agriculture, and it commissioned the International Food Policy Research Institute to edit a book based on these background studies. The resulting book, Gender in Agriculture: Closing the Knowledge Gap, is a compendium of what we now know about gender gaps in agriculture and why such gaps matter.",Open Access,,"Quisumbing, Agnes R.

381,"Good nutrition is the bedrock upon which to build healthy lives, strong and resilient livelihoods, and thriving economies. In its absence, their construction takes place on quicksand. Stunted children fail to grow and develop properly, with impairment to brains and immune systems being particular problems. Malnourished women of childbearing age do not have enough iron in their blood to feed their muscles. Many adults carry so much excess weight they put their heart and lungs under extreme stress and may suffer from diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. Malnutrition leads to 11 percent of gross national product being squandered as a result of lives lost, less learning in school, less earning in the workplace, and days lost to illness.",Open Access,http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/27857,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH),128696.pdf,128485,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2499/9780896298613,10.2499/9780896298613,,2014-11-13,2021-08-24,interactive map http://www.globalnutritionreport.org/data-and-visualization-platform,"International Food Policy Research Institute. 2014.

Less-than-ideal growing conditions, limited suitable space for expansion, and a lack of infrastructure and support services may limit farmers’ prospects and give them few incentives to invest. The Atlas of African Agriculture Research & Development helps illustrate how African farmers, and those who strive to serve them, simultaneously face large and diverse challenges as well as opportunities for boosting productivity.

415,"The recent drought in the Horn of Africa has again generated widespread pessimism about the future of pastoralism in the re-gion. In this paper we argue that a much more balanced development strategy needs to be adopted in pastoralist areas. First, livelihood diversification must become a positive process, through education, infrastructure, and policies facilitating migration and nonfarm investments. Second, economic transformation must involve a social and demographic transition through reduced fertility rates. And third, transformation of the traditional agricultural sector, dominated by livestock, is needed and is inevita-ble for the simple reason that it is simply too large to ignore, and no amount of livelihood diversification can create enough jobs to pull pastoralists out of poverty. Commercialization efforts, drought management practices, and institutional reforms are the three basic pillars to make the sector more profitable and more resilient to droughts. In addition to all this, interventions in pastoralist areas need to make greater use of innovative practices, such as ICTs, mobile service delivery, and spatial clustering of services.",Open Access,,"Headey, Derek D.

Based on unique data from a quasi-experimental setting in northwestern Ethiopia, this study examines the “last mile(s)”—from the input distribution center to the farmer—in the chemical fertilizer and improved seed distribution system. We find that increasing transaction and transportation costs over a 35 kilometer distance contribute to a significant decline in incentives for modern input adoption and lead to a reduction to one quarter in modern input use. Farmers who live about 10 km from the distribution center face per unit transaction and transportation costs as high as the costs needed to bring the ferti-lizer from the international port to the input distribution center (about 1,000 km). Tackling the “last mile” costs should thus be a priority to improve modern input adoption in the country.",Open Access,,"Minten, Bart

Results indicate that the program to scale-up row planting, on average, has a positive but moderate effect on teff yield. These findings, however, are in contrast with larger yield increases found on village demonstration plots, in more controlled settings, and with the expectations of teff farmers. The differences are linked to problems in the implementation of the program and of its recommendations, to methodological issues, and likely to over-optimism on the potential of row planting in real farm settings.",Open Access,,"Vandercasteelen, Joachim

By 2012, at least 12 crops with a number of GM traits were planted on 170 million hectares in 28 countries. Most adopting countries have commercialized these crops after implementing regulatory frameworks that include standard food and environmental risk assessments. Numerous countries, including some in Africa, are making decisions based not only on these risk assessments but also on the potential socioeconomic effects of GM crops’ adoption and use, such as their impact on trade and farmers’ income.",Open Access,,"Horna, Daniela

We discuss the merits of liberalizing germplasm provision to all seed companies vs those of exclusive rights to preserve product differentiation and ensure standard seed quality to protect the brand. We find that exclusive or not, risk-sharing arrangements with any company that takes up this product would be essential. Regardless of the involvement of the seed companies, building and maintaining a unique brand for provitamin A-rich maize that clearly distinguishes it from the many varieties that exist on the market will be fundamental to successful delivery strategies.",Open Access,,"Smale, Melinda

First, there is increasing adoption of modern inputs (chemical fertilizer, improved varieties, and herbicides) by farmers, especially by those living close to urban centers. Second, quality demands are rising and there are important shifts from the cheap red varieties to the more expensive white ones. Third, we see an increasing willingness-to-pay for convenience in urban areas, as illustrated by the emergence of one-stop retail shops—that provide sales, cleaning, milling, and transport services—as well as by a sizable foodservice industry. Fourth, the share of rural–urban market-ing, urban distribution, and milling margins in final retail prices is declining, indicating improved marketing efficiency over time.",Open Access,,"Minten, Bart

Overall the targeting principles laid out in the Project Implementation Manual are being followed, but with some regional variation. Over time, community understanding of targeting criteria improved across most of the PSNP regions. From an international perspec-tive, the PSNP is well-targeted. The need for continuous capacity building and the level of follow-up and monitoring from higher level implementers have important implications for how well communities can target resources to the poorest.",Open Access,,"Coll-Black, Sarah

444,"Weather risk remains a major challenge to farming in poor countries that face frequent droughts. Recent evidence on index-based weather insurance points to low take-up rates largely due to basis risk (i.e. residual risk left uninsured by the index). Using randomized control trials, we study to what extent traditional groups can be utilized to mitigate basis risk by retailing insurance through these groups. We find that selling insurance through iddirs, with pre-defined sharing rules, increases take-up—suggesting that groups are better placed to reduce basis risk. We also find that insurance strengthens existing risk-sharing behavior within groups, for example, by improving access to loans from the iddir to cover crop losses and improving perceived ability to finance emergencies. Insurance has also improved household welfare in the short term considered in this study, albeit to a limited extent.",Open Access,,"Berhane, Guush

Our results suggest that female house-hold heads and plot managers are less likely to get extension services and are less likely to access quality services than their male counterparts. Receiving advice from development agents, as agricultural extension officers in Ethiopia are called, is strongly and positively related to adoption of improved seed and fertilizer for both female and male headed households. How-ever, visits by or advice from development agents do not significantly affect productivity, for both females and males. The re-sults highlight the need for closing the gender gap in the provision of extension services and in productivity.",Open Access,,"Ragasa, Catherine

How to foster agricultural development and food security in West Africa despite the effects of climate change and other challenges is the subject of the study West African Agriculture and Climate Change: A Comprehensive Analysis. The authors develop several weather-based scenarios for how climate change might affect countries in the region between now and 2050. National contributors from Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo review the scenario results for their countries and propose a variety of policies to counter the effects of climate change on agriculture and food security.

From 1995 to 2004, nearly all of IFPRI’s Ethiopia work was undertaken by Washington-based research teams working on specific themes under various “global research programs” (GRPs). More than 95 percent of IFPRI’s research in Ethiopia during this period was part of four main research themes: (1) Market Development; (2) Poverty and Food Security; (3) Public Investment; and (4) Sustainable Land Management (SLM).",Open Access,,"Renkow, Mitch

It shows that the world has made some progress in reducing hunger since 1990, but still has far to go. The 2013 GHI report focuses on resilience in theory and in practice. The relief and development communities have long struggled to understand why some people fare better than others when confronting stresses or shocks. Given that world hunger remains “serious” according to the index, resilience-building efforts are much needed to help poor and vulnerable people cope with hunger seasons, droughts, and other natural and manmade disasters both short-term and long-term. Building resilience will involve boosting food and nutrition security. In order to achieve that goal, the humanitarian and development communities must work together.",Open Access,http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/22795,"von Grebmer, Klaus

493,"In 2000, the member states of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) signaled their commitment to the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger and poverty by 2015 (MDG1). To achieve that goal, agriculture in the region needed to grow by 6.8 percent annually. From 2000 to 2009, however, West African agriculture grew at half the desired rate—3.7 percent—due to many biophysical and socioeconomic constraints, including heavy reliance on rainfed production systems, traditional practices of soil fertility maintenance, and limited access to markets. Consequently, crop yields in West Africa are significantly lower than global averages, and their rate of increase has barely kept up with population growth. Cereal production in West Africa increased by 4.4 percent per annum from 1980 to 2009, an annual growth rate only marginally above the population growth rate. About two-thirds of this growth was accounted for by expanding cultivated area; one-third represented yield growth.",Open Access,,"Bumb, Balu L.

An important tool has been to increase the availability of improved seed, chemical fertilizers, and extension services for small-scale, resource-poor farmers. While there is some evidence to suggest that the process has led to improvements in both agricultural output and yields, there is an urgent need for more substantial progress. A rethinking of approaches is required, one that reallocates the roles of the public and private sectors in the agricultural input sector.",Open Access,,"Spielman, David J.

Some argue that foreign aid has no effect on growth and may sometimes even undermine growth in aid recipient countries. Others suggest that foreign aid positively influences economic growth. Still others suggest that foreign aid has a positive impact on growth but this impact is conditional on a good institutional and policy environment. This debate has high stakes, given that foreign aid in the form of official development assistance (ODA) by leading donor nations reached over US$120 billion in 2010, the highest level ever recorded.",Open Access,,"Akramov, Kamiljon T.",,127468.pdf,127257,,,https://doi.org/10.2499/9780896298095,10.2499/9780896298095,,2012-11-19,2021-09-21,,"Akramov, Kamiljon T. 2012.

Analysis suggests that plots that received investment in the first period (1992) experience a 20.6 percent higher value of production in 2010. Although value of production increases with investment, results indicate that SLWM infrastructure must be maintained for at least seven years in order to reap positive increases in value of production. Although value of production increases over time, benefits may not outweigh costs in the short term, and mechanisms to incentivize farmers to maintain the SLWM infrastructure on their plots may be needed.",Open Access,,"Schmidt, Emily

503,"We estimate households’ willingness-to-pay for rural feeder roads in Ethiopia. Using a quasi-experimental setting, we find that the benefits of reducing transportation costs by 50 US dollars per metric ton of goods (agricultural surplus, purchased consumption goods, purchased agricultural inputs) would result in benefits worth roughly 35 percent of household consumption. A hypothetical gravel road of 21 km (a road built halfway through the survey site) that lasts 10 years will have an internal rate of return (a measure for the profitability of an investment) that ranges from 12 to 34 percent, using conservative assumptions. These results suggest that investments in rural feeder roads are cost-effective ways to help reduce widespread poverty even in unfavorable settings where small-scale farmers have low levels of marketed agricultural surplus, nonfarm earnings opportunities are negligible, and the provision of motorized transport services is not guaranteed.",Open Access,,"Stifel, David

Among the economic sectors that improved was agriculture, which grew 3.4 percent per year over 2001-2010, outpacing Africa’s population growth rate, which was 2.5 percent, for the first time in the last three decades. Nevertheless, the agricultural sector’s growth has lagged behind national economic growth in Africa. Given",Open Access,,"Diao, Xinshen

506,"As the population continues to grow and natural resources become scarcer, the need to shift toward an environmen­tally responsible, socially accountable, more equitable, and “greener” economy has become increasingly apparent. Despite differing perspectives and definitions among stakeholders, the “green economy” is often seen as an economy that pursues growth while also promoting sustainable development through more efficient use of resources. Thus aligned with concepts of sustainability, the objective of a green economy is to simultaneously work toward economic development, environmental protection, and greater social welfare, in particular by reducing reliance on fossil fuels and nonrenewable resources.",Open Access,,"Fan, Shenggen

We find that these changes are associated with significant declines in real price differences between supplying and receiving markets, in cereal milling margins, as well as in retail margins. Important improvements have thus happened in the last decade in Ethiopia’s food marketing system, traditionally identified as a major cause of food security problems in the country.",Open Access,,"Minten, Bart

Effectiveness of an RPO is expressed as the percentage of farmer members who used the RPO for marketing some of their production in 2009. To identify factors that influence RPO effectiveness, a censored least absolute deviations estimator regression was run. The explanatory variables considered as possible factors that influence RPO effectiveness included democratic governance mechanisms, the skills of leaders, RPO size, financial base, gender composition of the membership, and bulking distance. Results show that RPO size, democratic leadership and higher proportions of women membership in RPOs have a significant positive effect on RPO effectiveness. On the other hand, the proportion of RPO leaders trained in leadership and involved in related business activities have a significant negative effect on RPO effectiveness.",Open Access,,"Ampaire, Edidah

We use the CSA Consumer Price Survey to construct a real wage series for the urban poor, and to conduct formal econometric tests of whether wages adjust to food and non-food price inflation over the short run and the long run. We find that although real wages were trending upward in the early 2000s, the rapid inflation episodes of 2007–2008 and 2010–2011 led to serious short run declines in purchasing power, on the order of 10–26% depending on the episodes, the region, and the wage indicator analyzed. The severity of these shocks justifies further consideration of social safety nets for urban areas.",Open Access,,"Headey, Derek D.

530,"The majority of farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) lack the means to mitigate the impact of risks associated with rainfall and commodity prices due to financial constraints and the imperfect insurance markets in these countries. Because most SSA farmers are risk averse, they may be willing to invest in productive assets that can mitigate the impacts of such risks if their financial constraints are relaxed through external financial assistance. We analyze panel data on investment behavior of Nigerian farmers who received financial assistance for acquiring productive assets. The empirical results show that farmers facing higher rainfall risks are more likely to invest in irrigation pumps that can mitigate the impact of poor rainfall. Similarly, farmers facing the higher price fluctuations for unmilled cassava (gari) are more likely to invest in milling machines that enable them to sell milled cassava, an alternative cassava product with a more stable price.

The country relied on donor sources for much of its research funding in the 1990s, but by 2003 most donors had suspended their operations in Zimbabwe. Exacerbating matters, currency devaluations and hyperin ation during 2002–08 further eroded funding levels at agricultural R&D agencies and hence their ability to conduct viable research. This situation also led to high staff turnover, with many researchers moving to the private sector or to other countries. From a peak of almost 300 full-time equivalent (FTE) researchers in 1989, R&D capacity fell to a low of 139 FTEs in 2007, rebounding slightly to 148 FTEs in 2008 (Figure 1; Table 1).",Open Access,,"Flaherty, Kathleen

Meeting these multiple challenges requires changes in the agricultural sector. Farmer-driven adaptation in Kenya and elsewhere in East Africa must include sustainable agricultural management practices. Many of these management practices also directly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing agricultural productivity and net revenues. This note is based on a report on the synergies and tradeoffs of agricultural management strategies used by farmers in seven districts in Kenya, spanning the country’s arid, semi-arid, temperate, and humid agroecological zones (AEZs).

Similarly, certain agricultural development projects and practices that aid productivity (for example, the use of pesticides and the water harvesting techniques, storage structures, and dams involved with irrigation) can actually exacerbate the incidence of diseases in workers by increasing interactions with disease vectors and parasites. Failure to consider either the negative or positive health effects of certain farm practices or interventions can distort their impact; for example, an estimate of the real economic benefits of adopting pest-resistant crops or organic farming must take into account the positive health impacts accruing from decreased pesticide use.",Open Access,,"Asenso-Okyere, Kwadwo

This brief argues that growth is good, but is not enough to improve nutrition. During the early stages of development, growth helps reduce the prevalence of calorie deficiency, and, in most countries, agricultural growth plays a key role. But malnutrition becomes less responsive to growth as its prevalence rate declines, so economic diversification into the manufacturing and service sectors becomes necessary to leverage further reductions in malnutrition, especially as people migrate into urban areas. Nevertheless, growth—whether driven by the agriculture or nonagriculture sectors—is insufficient to address child malnutrition and reduce micronutrient malnutrition in all their dimensions. Strategic investments and special programs are needed in the complementary sectors of health and education as well.",Open Access,,"Ecker, Olivier

Frequent droughts and floods have cost the Kenyan economy billions of Ksh, and adverse impacts and costs are expected to rise over time. Drought is by far the most pressing climate-related shock experienced by Kenyan farmers, resulting in declines in crop yields, food shortages, and food price spikes. At the same time, climate change is expected to result in a drier coast while the highlands and northern Kenya are likely to become wetter. However, increases in rainfall in lowland areas may not lead to increases in agricultural productivity since increases in temperature will also increase evapotranspiration, offsetting any potential increase in productivity; and increases in precipitation elsewhere will be too low to support a growing season.

Are more nutrition-specific interventions required, such as food/nutrient supplements or training and education programs? Or does the answer lie in broader social developments such as rising incomes, increased food security, and better access to education, health, infrastructure, and family planning services? These factors can all be seen as facets of integrated socioeconomic growth, but stakeholders rightly point to examples of economic growth leading to little or no reduction in childhood malnutrition.

575,"A review of various economic indicators shows that both the recent food crisis and the financial and economic crisis have had significant negative effects on the Central American countries. The first jolt to the region came in 2007 and mid-2008, while the second occurred at the end of 2008 and in 2009. Particularly notable during 2007 and the first half of 2008 was the inflation that hit the food and beverage sector, which consistently outpaced overall inflation in Central America. The rise in prices coincided with the upward trend in international prices for the main agricultural commodities. The impact of the financial and economic crisis was reflected in declining exports, particularly for the maquila industry, reduced tourist inflows, a decrease in remittances from abroad, and a decline in flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) to the region. These factors, in combination, contributed to a contraction of economic activity in Central America in 2009.",Open Access,,"Hernandez, Manuel A.

576,"Nanotechnology is research and development that involves measuring and manipulating matter at the atomic, molecular, and supramolecular levels at scales measured in approximately 1 to 100 nanometers (nm) in at least one dimension.”Materials at such small scales often exhibit different electrical, magnetic, optical, mechanical, and other physical properties from their bulk material counterparts, leading to the development of potentially revolutionary technologies in a variety of industries,including agriculture and food. By increasing productivity, reducing postharvest loss, improving product quality, increasing the competitiveness of agricultural producers, and improving market access, advances in nanotechnology may present new opportunities to improve the livelihoods of the poor. But nanotechnology may also create new risks.Investments in agriculture and food nanotechnologies carry increasing weight because their potential benefits range from improved food quality and safety to reduced agricultural inputs and improved processing and nutrition. While most investment is made primarily in developed countries, research advancements provide glimpses of potential applications in agricultural, food, and water safety that could have significant impacts on rural populations in developing countries.Despite their promise, agricultural and food nanotechnologies, especially those that could reduce poverty or increase food and nutrition security, will likely face many challenges in each step of development—from investment in research and development (R&D) to adoption and use—before being commercialized and used by the rural poor. Many of these obstacles appear in the development of any new technology, but there are also issues specific to nanotechnology: intellectual property rights (IPR), the management of safety and environmental risks in the presence of wide uncertainties, and possible market displacement effects induced by these technologies, among other concerns. This brief presents a review of the potential opportunities and challenges of using nanotech applications for agriculture, food, and water in developing countries.",Open Access,,"Gruère, Guillaume P.

Arab governments appeared to be in tight control, and many Arab economies were growing around or above the world average over the past few years. Annual growth rates in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, and Sudan averaged more than 6 percent between 2005 and 2010; and Syria, Tunisia, and Libya grew at about 5 percent on average during the same period of time. Official poverty rates in most Arab countries are lower than in many Asian and Latin American countries. However, experts have long identified slow progress in economic diversification and job creation, social inequalities, and persistent food insecurity as major development challenges for Arab countries. Did these factors and, more broadly, people’s dissatisfaction with their living standards contribute to the recent uprisings? At first glance, the sudden turn of events and the generally low coverage, quality, and accessibility of data in the Arab world make it difficult to find answers to this question. By looking beyond more conventional data, however, this policy brief provides some insights into the potential role of economics in the ongoing uprisings. It also reviews major policy responses of Arab governments and provides a new narrative of Arab development that is based on inclusive economic transformation, food security, and decisionmaking.",Open Access,,"Breisinger, Clemens

578,"Whether viewed as “land grabs” or as agricultural investment for development, large-scale land deals by investors in developing countries are generating considerable attention. However, investors, policymakers, officials, and other key stakeholders have paid little attention to a dimension of these deals essential to truly understanding their impact: gender. It is easy to laud outside investment in agriculture, or to deride land deals and the accompanying processes as bad or unfair, without looking at the benefits and costs to local men and women. The results of land deals depend in part on the prior rights and responsibilities of women and men and in part on how the land deal’s implementation perpetuates, improves, or distorts these rights and responsibilities. A wide-ranging body of evidence forms a clear rationale for prioritizing gender issues in agriculture. Households often do not act as a single unit when allocating food and nonfood resources, which means all household members may not benefit from providing the male household head with more income. Evidence shows that improvements in household agricultural productivity, food security, and nutrition must address women’s needs because, in many parts of the world, women are more likely than men to spend the income they control on food, healthcare, and their children’s education. Conversely, land deals can reduce the welfare of women and their families, even if men’s income increases. Land-related investments promoted in the name of “rural development” will miss their mark unless the many actors involved—including national and local governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the research community, and investors—recognize and address the needs of women as well as men.",Open Access,,"Behrman, Julia A.

579,"Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) have become a popular tool to reduce poverty and inequality in the short run and to promote investments in human capital. CCTs are now present in almost all parts of the developing world, especially in Latin America. As the name indicates, CCT programs transfer money to a targeted group conditional on the recipient’s behavior, such as school attendance for children, vaccinations, health checks for infants and pregnant women, and attendance of workshops on hygiene and nutrition.Oportunidades (previously named Progresa) is a CCT program in Mexico that consists of three components: one related to education, one to health, and one to nutrition. According to Levy (2006), Oportunidades transfers represent, on average, 25 percent of household income for Mexico’s rural poor and between 15 and 20 percent for the urban poor1. The program has expanded rapidly since its inception: starting from 140 thousand households in August 1997, it reached 5 million households at the beginning of 2008. Given its large size, Oportunidades is expected to have large indirect and second-round effects on the economy. To measure these effects, IFPRI researchers are using innovative modeling techniques in a project to assess the impact of Oportunidades, looking at how it has contributed to a) increasing the income of beneficiary households; b) increasing labor productivity; and c) reducing child labor in the short run.",Open Access,,"Dorosh, Paul A.

This land value reassessment has been prompted by rising crop prices and perceived land scarcity. But even as the value of land rises, land degradation continues and investments to prevent it are lagging. Awareness of environmental risks has moved to the forefront of global consciousness during the past 25 years. However, this awareness has not translated into comprehensive action to address the problem of land degradation, which poses a serious threat to long-term food security. This inaction is primarily the result of limited knowledge of the costs related to land degradation and of insufficient institutional support. Policy action and research are needed to resolve this paradox of high-value land and low levels of investment.",Open Access,,"Nkonya, Ephraim M.

But the benefits and costs of different FFE program models, including Community Based School Feeding (CBSF) programs that may also contribute to local agricultural development, must be carefully considered if such programs are to be successful in improving the nutritional status of their beneficiaries, increasing educational attainment, strengthening human capital and, ultimately, accelerating human development in Uganda.",Open Access,,"Korugyendo, Patrick Lubega

The Agreement on Agriculture laid the way for the pursuit of progressive reductions in world agricultural market distortions. Its supporters hoped the new rules and commitments would encourage countries to move domestic farm policies in a less trade-distorting direction. This research brief examines the Agreement’s domestic support disciplines and their potential strengthening under the as-yet unfinished Doha Round negotiations. The brief provides a summary of the main conclusions from the March 2011 book WTO Disciplines on Agricultural Support: Seeking a Fair Basis for Trade. The analysis focuses on four developed countries (the United States, the European Union [as a single “country”], Japan, and Norway) and four developing countries (Brazil, China, India, and the Philippines). We highlight the substantial differences among these countries in their notifications of policy measures and the support they provide. Where a complete set of notifications is not available for 1995–2008, estimates (“shadow” notifications) are constructed. Domestic support is also projected through the mid-2010s and compared to existing and potential WTO commitments.",Open Access,,"Orden, David

The results suggest that Ethiopian households display significant responses to changes in prices and income.

Global circulation models (GCMs), which provide an understanding of climate and project climate change, tend to agree that temperatures are increasing across the region, but models vary widely regarding predicted changes in precipitation—with the exception of some agreement that precipitation decreases from June to August in southern Africa and increases from December to February in eastern Africa. Whether the Sahel will be more or less wet in the future remains uncertain. Given the limited agreement of GCMs, the University of Illinois and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) developed a global comprehensive climate change scenario combining 17 models selected for their past performance in predicting temperature and precipitation.",Open Access,,"Ringler, Claudia

590,Public investment in agriculture and rural infrastructure is an important driver of agricultural growth and has a significant bearing on poverty outcomes. Determining the right levels and types of investments requires that policymakers have reliable and context-specific information about the impacts of different types of public investments. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) initiated its Global Research Program on Priorities for Public Investment in Agriculture and Rural Areas (GRP-3) in 1998 to provide such information.,Open Access,,"Renkow, Mitch",,127688.pdf,127477,,,,,,2013-04-05,2015-07-02,,,,,"IFPRI1

However, the development of cooperatives has been limited by inadequate research. There is a dearth of up to date literature on the status of African cooperatives since the liberalization of the agriculture sector in the mid-1990s (Wanyama et al. 2008). In addition, policymakers, practitioners, and others harbor outdated views on cooperatives, hampering progress in the sector. Cooperatives in Uganda, especially those involved in cash crops, successfully provided agricultural-related services to farmers until the mid-1980s. At that time, due to political instability, liberalization of markets, and mismanagement, among other reasons, almost all the cooperatives failed. However, a few survived, and cooperatives are enjoying a revival in Uganda. This policy note is based on a case study of the recent revival and reform of the agricultural cooperative sector in Uganda.",Open Access,,"Kwapong, Nana Afranaa

592,"Since the establishment of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1976, microfinance has boomed. As of December 31, 2007, 3,552 microcredit institutions had reached 154 million clients worldwide, about 106.6 million of whom were among the poorest when they took their first loan. Such expansion can be at least partly attributed to the widely adopted practice of group lending in microfinance programs. In contrast to individual lending, group lending (or joint liability) grants a loan to a group of borrowers, and the whole group is liable for the debt of any individual member in the group. This practice allows microfinance programs to rely mainly on accountability and mutual trust among group members rather than financial collateral to insure against default. Given that the poor often lack appropriate financial collateral, group lending programs offer a feasible way of extending credit to poor people who are usually kept out of traditional banking systems.",Open Access,,"Deininger, Klaus

609,"After three decades of fluctuating but overall diminishing public agricultural research and development (R&D) spending in Zambia, the downward trend of investment accelerated during 2001-08. In 2008, Zambia spent 20 billion kwacha or 8 million PPP dollars on public agricultural R&D, both in 2005 constant prices, compared with 24 billion kwacha or about 10 million PPP dollars in 2001, and 89 billion kwacha or 37 million PPP in 1991. Unless otherwise stated, all dollar values in this note are expressed in purchasing power parity (PPP) prices. PPPs reflect the purchasing power of currencies more effectively than do standard exchange rates because they compare the prices of a broader range of local-as opposed to internationally traded-goods and services. Public agricultural R&D capacity increased in the 1980s, then experienced a sharp decline in the early 1990s. A period of growth in the mid-1990s was then followed by another period of contraction, up through 2006, primarily due to a government-sector hiring freeze imposed from 2002 until 2007. When recruitment resumed, research capacity grew quickly and returned to mid-1990s levels by 2008, with a total of 209 full-time equivalent (FTE) research staff employed that year.",Open Access,,"Flaherty, Kathleen

However, the development of cooperatives has been limited by inadequate research. There is a dearth of up to date literature on the status of African cooperatives since the liberalization of the agriculture sector in the mid-1990s (Wanyama et al. 2008). In addition, policymakers, practitioners, and others harbor outdated views on cooperatives, hampering progress in the sector. Cooperatives in Uganda, especially those involved in cash crops, successfully provided agricultural-related services to farmers until the mid-1980s. At that time, due to political instability, liberalization of markets, and mismanagement, among other reasons, almost all the cooperatives failed. However, a few survived, and cooperatives are enjoying a revival in Uganda. This policy note is based on a case study of the recent revival and reform of the agricultural cooperative sector in Uganda.",Open Access,,"Kwapong, Nana Afranaa

As of December 31, 2007, 3,552 microcredit institutions had reached 154 million clients worldwide, about 106.6 million of whom were among the poorest when they took their first loan. Such expansion can be at least partly attributed to the widely adopted practice of group lending in microfinance programs. In contrast to individual lending, group lending (or joint liability) grants a loan to a group of borrowers, and the whole group is liable for the debt of any individual member in the group. This practice allows microfinance programs to rely mainly on accountability and mutual trust among group members rather than financial collateral to insure against default. Given that the poor often lack appropriate financial collateral, group lending programs offer a feasible way of extending credit to poor people who are usually kept out of traditional banking systems.",Open Access,,"Deininger, Klaus

This often results in policy actions lagging far behind scientific and academic knowledge, the presence of avoidable inefficiencies in policy design and implementation, and policies that may not fulfill their purpose. While there is no real consensus on how to successfully improve linkages between research and policy, it is clear that understanding the specific context in which policy decisions take place is critical. To better understand the dynamics between agricultural research and policymaking in Nigeria, we examined the 2006 National Fertilizer Policy for Nigeria and the process that led to its writing and adoption.",Open Access,,"Aberman, Noora-Lisa

However, access to important social and economic services remains limited, especially for rural populations. The deficiencies in service delivery have been exacerbated by a strong urban bias in development policies and growing fiscal imbalances among the three tiers of government: national, state, and local. In particular, Nigeria faces a challenge in efficiently and effectively delivering agricultural and rural services at the local level to help the agricultural sector grow and alleviate poverty. To overcome this challenge, research suggests that the subnational governments, especially local governments, must be empowered with adequate tax and revenue authority to carry out their jurisdictional responsibilities.

635,"South Asia is home to the largest concentration of poor and undernourished people in the world, so food security—especially in basic staples such as wheat, rice, and corn—continues to be a major concern. With both persistent and re-emerging food price inflation reaching new heights in 2007–08 in global markets, South Asia saw sharp inflation—between 50 and 100 percent—in basic staples in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. These drastic price spikes drew comprehensive policy responses from the governments of these countries, addressing both supply and demand for foodgrains. India, the largest economy in the region, reacted by banning exports of common rice, wheat, and corn, as well as suspending these commodities from futures trading, to ensure comfortable supplies in the domestic market at affordable prices. India also launched a National Food Security Mission in 2007 and announced a special agricultural package (Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana) of roughly US$6 billion to rejuvenate its agriculture. Today, South Asian countries want a greater degree of self-sufficiency; reliance on trade to achieve food security is being questioned by critics. Against this backdrop, a recent book published for the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) by Oxford University Press, Liberalizing Foodgrains Markets: Experiences, Impact, and Lessons from South Asia, studies the nature of reforms in foodgrains markets (both within-border and at-border reforms), their evolution, and their effects on food economy in general and food security in particular.

A large array of uncontrollable elements can affect output production and prices, resulting in highly variable economic returns to farm households. In developing countries, farmers also lack access to both modern instruments of risk management—such as agricultural insurance, futures contracts, or guarantee funds—and ex post emergency government assistance. Such farmers rely on different “traditional” coping strategies and risk-mitigation techniques, but most of these are inefficient. Formal and semiformal arrangements—such as contract farming, joint-liability lending, and value-chain integration—have arisen in recent decades, but they too are limited and can be very context sensitive. One consequence of inadequate overall financial risk management is that farmers in general face constrained access to formal finance. The smaller the net worth of the farm household, the worse the degree of exclusion.",Open Access,,"Wenner, Mark",,7507.cpd,7506,,,,,,2017-06-06,2017-06-06,,,,,"IFPRI1

Many of the best-studied programs targeting women in Bangladesh- particularly microfinance programs directed toward poor women-have operated through women's groups. In these programs, group liability acts as a substitute for personally owned assets as a form of collateral. Whereas some evidence does suggest that collective action has a positive impact on gender relations and broader development objectives like reducing poverty, when evaluating impact, many studies do not satisfactorily account for other factors associated with participation in collective action. For example, it is possible that women who are more ""empowered"" to begin with are more likely both to participate in and benefit from collective-action programs, perhaps because of greater wealth, higher levels of schooling, or better social connectedness. The panel data set employed in this study addresses this issue by providing the necessary conditions for more rigorous, long-term impact evaluation.",Open Access,,"Kumar, Neha

Several researchers were killed by rebels, research facilities and equipment were destroyed or severely damaged, and many research stations were abandoned as staff took refuge in Freetown (Asenso-Okyere et al. 2009). When peace was finally declared in 2002, Sierra Leone embarked on what will be a long road toward reconstructing its agricultural research infrastructure and capacity. As a result, agricultural R&D spending rose rapidly. In 2009, the country invested 7.5 billion leones or 6.9 million PPP dollars on agricultural R&D (both in 2005 prices) compared with just 2.2 billion leones or 2.8 million dollars in 2001 (Figure 1; Table 1). Unless otherwise stated, all prices in this note are based on purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates, which reflect the purchasing power of currencies more effectively than do standard exchange rates because they compare the prices of a broader range of local-as opposed to internationally traded-goods and services. Total agricultural R&D capacity has also risen gradually since the cessation of hostilities.

Health facilities are less available and less well equipped in rural areas; water, sanitation, roads, and telecommunication are less developed; and people are less educated and not as aware of risk-mitigation mechanisms.

S&T indicators assist research managers and policymakers in policy formulation and decision-making on strategic planning, priority setting, monitoring, and evaluation. They also provide information to government and other institutions (e.g., policy research institutes, universities, and the private sector) involved in the public debate on the state of agricultural S&T at national, regional, and international levels. This country brief reviews the major investment, capacity, and institutional trends in public agricultural research in Argentina since 1981, using data collected under the Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) initiative conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) in 2007-08.1 It provides important updates on trends in Argentina�s public agricultural research collected by the ASTI initiative during the mid-1990s.",Open Access,,"Stads, Gert-Jan

They also usually have one or two buffaloes or cows, reared for milk and dung. Most of these small and marginal farmers fall below the poverty line. To reduce overall poverty in India, it is important to enhance the incomes of small and marginal farmers. One way to do that is to provide credit so they can get access to yield-enhancing inputs like seed, fertilizer, and cattle feed, as well as acquire irrigation pumps and crossbred cattle. But these kinds of investments alone will not raise farmers' incomes. Agricultural and livestock development services are also crucial to give farmers knowledge of improved practices and strengthen their links to markets.",Open Access,,"Mahajan, Vijay

The new government faced a long process of establishing public-sector organizations to stimulate economic growth and provide basic services. Strengthening national agricultural research and development (R&D) and extension services was high on the list of priorities. In the first years after independence, the country's agricultural output, as well as its agricultural R&D expenditures, rose rapidly following an influx of support from foreign donors. Nevertheless, renewed conflict with Ethiopia in 1998 led to dramatic cuts in funding from both donors and the national government (Beintema, Okubay, and Debass 2003). In 2008, Eritrea invested 11.7 million nakfas or 1.9 million PPP dollars (in 2005 prices) in agricultural R&D, down from 90 million nakfas or 14 million PPP dollars a decade earlier, which represents a drop of 80 percent.",Open Access,,"Rahija, Michael

The cultivated area in the basin is about 13 percent of the total cultivated area in China, but the basin holds only 3 percent of the country’s water resources. At the same time, the basin provides water to an estimated 150 million people—both inside and outside the basin area—and rapidly growing industries in the downstream area and, more recently, the midstream area, where mining and chemical industries are expanding. As a result, the basin faces severe water shortages. To address decades of river-flow cutoffs, the government enforced the cross-provincial, quota-based Water Allocation Agreement of 1987 through Unified Water Flow Regulation (UWFR) in 1999. This policy was in line with the past decade’s renewed focus on sustainable water use and efforts by the Government of China to keep the Yellow River “healthy.” The UWFR, however, did not take into account the value of water in various uses, and water users forced to give up water resources—primarily irrigators in the upstream and midstream provinces—were not compensated.",Open Access,,"Cai, Ximing

665,"Agricultural growth offers a potentially powerful tool for spearheading broad-based poverty reduction in Africa. In a continent where 70 percent of the poor work in agriculture, an upsurge in farm productivity contributes directly to broad increases in rural income. In addition, a prosperous agriculture generates powerful growth linkages to the rest of the economy, providing cheap food, raw materials, and a growing demand for nascent processing and service industries. Even the urban poor, who spend the majority of their income on food, see their real incomes rise when growing agricultural productivity and output enable reduc-tions in staple food prices. Consequently, growing agricultural productivity attacks poverty from three different directions. It increases the productivity and incomes of the majority of Africa’s poor, who work primarily in agriculture. It reduces food prices, which govern real incomes and poverty in urban areas, and generates important spill-overs to the rest of the economy.",Open Access,,"Haggblade, Steven

In 2008, the country invested 336 million Mauritian rupees or 23 million PPP dollars on agricultural R&D, compared with 456 million rupees or 31 million PPP dollars in 2002 (in 2005 prices), representing a decrease of about 25 percent. Note that, unless otherwise stated, all dollar values in this note are based on PPP exchange rates. PPPs reflect the purchasing power of currencies more effectively than do standard exchange rates because they compare prices of a broader range of local-as opposed to internationally traded-goods and services.

There is a lack of empirical information on how much more farmers are willing to pay (WTP) for seeds at planting time compared to a few months before planting time. The information on such WTP can help assess the feasibility of public sector support for the timely delivery of improved seeds. This study estimates how farmers' WTP for rice, cowpea and maize seeds varies depending on the purchase timing, using information on both farmers' observed purchase behaviors and their stated preferences. Results indicate that low-income farmers may prefer to pay higher prices for cowpea seeds if those seeds can be bought closer to planting season.

686,"Even with abundant evidence of the urgent need for action on climate change mitigation, there are still those who consider mitigation strategies a burden. In the agricultural sector, climate change mitigation calls for changing some agricultural and resource management practices and technologies and often requires additional investment. However, there is an opportunity in agriculture for net benefit streams from a variety of zero- or low-cost mitigation opportunities ranging from agroforestry practices and restoration of degraded soils to zero-till and other land-management practices. Momentum has been generated to incorporate agriculture into carbon markets, potentially allowing smallholder farmers to access benefit streams from such transactions. However, who will receive the benefits from mitigation funds by, for example, increasing carbon stocks or reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land, will depend on the way different types of property rights are defined and dealt with in the upcoming climate change negotiations in Copenhagen. In many areas of the world, land tenure arrangements are complex. For example, in Africa, more than 90 percent of the land is formally claimed as state land, although millions of farming and pastoralist households use various customary and informal arrangements to access the land and other resources. Millions of hectares of forest and pastoral land in Asia and Latin America are similarly listed as state land, although used by communities, especially those of indigenous people or other marginalized ethnic groups. Often the same area may be under co-existing informal tenure systems, most of which are not recognized by formal land laws, but are instead accepted and enforced by the communities. Even where property rights are vested in a formal legal system with strong enforcement procedures, climate change mitigation measures raise new issues of who owns incremental carbon stocks and who should receive compensation for reductions in GHG emissions.",Open Access,,"Markelova, Helen

687,"Index-based insurance is an innovative financial product that has been introduced in recent years in countries as diverse as India, Malawi, Mongolia, and Thailand. It allows individual smallholder farmers to hedge against agricultural production risks, such as droughts or floods. The product pays out in events that are triggered by a publicly observable index, such as rainfall recorded on a local rain gauge. As a result, advocates argue that payouts can be calculated and disbursed quickly and automatically without the need for households to formally file a claim. This arrangement in turn reduces transaction costs, which would otherwise tend to drive up the price of the insurance. Fast payouts are also likely to be valued by policyholders in an environment where households are poor and often liquidity-constrained. Finally, the insurance product is free of adverse selection and moral hazard problems that often plague insurance markets because payouts are based only on publicly observed data rather than on private information reported by the person filing claims. Index-based insurance appears, therefore, to hold significant promise for rural households. Weather shocks to agricultural income generate fluctuations in household consumption that are not perfectly insured; at the extreme, they may lead to famine or death. Indeed, plenty of evidence suggests that households in developing countries are only partially insured and may thus avoid more profitable but riskier investments. Despite the benefits of index-based insurance, there are also some concerns. First, the product pays depending on the realization of an index, not on the actual crop yield or income of the farmer. Crop yields will relate to the index in complex ways that depend on soil moisture, evaporation, soil type, water runoff, and a variety of other factors. A good product will be one that maximizes the correlation between the index and what the client cares about. A variety of factors may discourage participation, such as household credit constraints, limited understanding of the product among potential consumers, limited trust in the insurance provider, or high transaction costs that raise the price of insurance. In a 2007 study on southern India by Giné, Townsend, and Vickery, the ratio of expected payouts on rainfall index insurance relative to premiums was estimated at only around 30 percent on average, compared with expected payouts equal to 65–76 percent of premiums for automobile and homeowners’ insurance in the United States. This relatively low payout rate may reflect a number of factors, including a lack of economies of scale given the small initial market for the product and the fact that the market is still in its infancy. More important in India, however, is the fact that high weather insurance payouts are correlated with poor macroeconomic conditions because of the dependence of the Indian economy on agriculture and the monsoon. These properties of insurance contracts are problematic to an insurer from a risk-management perspective. If rainfall insurance were written at a large scale, underwriters could limit their risk exposure by selling part of their rainfall risk to a reinsurer or by holding a significant capital buffer against potential losses. But both of these options are likely to be costly because of transaction costs, informational frictions, and tax concerns. The pros and cons of these types of products raise an important set of interrelated questions: What types of households buy index insurance? What factors prevent the remaining households from participating? And does the purchase of index insurance result in more efficient risk taking?",Open Access,,"Giné, Xavier",,22038.cpd,22037,,,,,,2017-06-28,2017-06-28,,,,,"IFPRI1

At an aggregate level it contributes to about 7 percent of Ghana’s GDP and more than 40 percent to the agricultural GDP (Aning et al. 2008). Within the livestock sector, poultry comprising chicken, ducks, guinea fowls, turkeys, and ostrich constitutes an integral part of the rural farming system. Though Ghana has some commercial and semi commercial large farms, most poultry production – an estimated 60 to 80 percent – takes place at a smaller scale, where chickens are free range with minimal use of purchased inputs. Ghana also imports poultry.

Ethiopia has not yet experienced an HPAI outbreak but has experienced a scare. An HPAI outbreak would cause a supply and demand shock to the poultry sector. Whereas supply shocks would be related directly to the disease and be local, demand shocks would be more dispersed across regions. Results of a dynamic spatially disaggregated multimarket model indicate that, given the poultry sector’s small contribution to the Ethiopian economy, the likely overall effect of an HPAI outbreak on the economy would be small.

693,"Rice is grown on more than 140 million hectares worldwide and is the most heavily consumed staple food on earth. Ninety percent of the world’s rice is produced and consumed in Asia, and 90 percent of rice land is—at least temporarily—flooded. The unique semiaquatic nature of the rice plant allows it to grow productively in places no other crop could exist, but it is also the reason for its emissions of the major greenhouse gas (GHG), methane. Methane emissions from rice fields are determined mainly by water regime and organic inputs, but they are also influenced by soil type, weather, tillage management, residues, fertilizers, and rice cultivar. Flooding of the soil is a prerequisite for sustained emissions of methane. Recent assessments of methane emissions from irrigated rice cultivation estimate global emissions for the year 2000 at a level corresponding to 625 million metric tons (mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Midseason drainage (a common irrigation practice adopted in major rice growing regions of China and Japan) and intermittent irrigation (common in northwest India) greatly reduce methane emissions. Similarly, rice environments with an insecure supply of water, namely rainfed rice, have a lower emission potential than irrigated rice. Organic inputs stimulate methane emissions as long as fields remain flooded. Therefore, organic inputs should be applied to aerobic soil in an effort to reduce methane emission. In addition to management factors, methane emissions are also affected by soil parameters and climate.",Open Access,,"Wassmann, Reiner

695,"Even with abundant evidence of the urgent need for action on climate change mitigation, there are still those who consider mitigation strategies a burden. In the agricultural sector, climate change mitigation calls for changing some agricultural and resource management practices and technologies and often requires additional investment. However, there is an opportunity in agriculture for net benefit streams from a variety of zero- or low-cost mitigation opportunities ranging from agroforestry practices and restoration of degraded soils to zero-till and other land-management practices. Momentum has been generated to incorporate agriculture into carbon markets, potentially allowing smallholder farmers to access benefit streams from such transactions. However, who will receive the benefits from mitigation funds by, for example, increasing carbon stocks or reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land, will depend on the way different types of property rights are defined and dealt with in the upcoming climate change negotiations in Copenhagen. In many areas of the world, land tenure arrangements are complex. For example, in Africa, more than 90 percent of the land is formally claimed as state land, although millions of farming and pastoralist households use various customary and informal arrangements to access the land and other resources. Millions of hectares of forest and pastoral land in Asia and Latin America are similarly listed as state land, although used by communities, especially those of indigenous people or other marginalized ethnic groups. Often the same area may be under co-existing informal tenure systems, most of which are not recognized by formal land laws, but are instead accepted and enforced by the communities. Even where property rights are vested in a formal legal system with strong enforcement procedures, climate change mitigation measures raise new issues of who owns incremental carbon stocks and who should receive compensation for reductions in GHG emissions.",Open Access,,"Markelova, Helen

697,"Questions in development economics often focus on the poor’s limited access to capital and, in particular, on their high interest rate for borrowing. Despite this high price for capital, many poor households borrow substantial amounts for production and consumption. This situation suggests that the poor have access to very productive investment opportunities and face periods when they have a very strong desire to consume more than their current income. This brief explores the role of microfinance in paying for unexpected consumption expenditures. Motivated by high borrowing costs among the poor, a large number and wide variety of organizations have made efforts to expand the availability of credit and decrease interest rates. Microfinance organizations are one prominent example, and loans are often also provided by banks, moneylenders, family, friends, and other local associations. Households also finance major expenditures using cash savings, funds from rotating savings groups, the sale or pawning of household items, insurance or entitlement programs, or gifts. Indeed, financial diaries show that the poor simultaneously use a large number of formal and informal financial instruments. It is not clear whether this large number of financial instruments represents an economic success or failure. Assuming that the poor are not simply tricked, each of these instruments is fulfilling some demand that is not met by the other instruments. This reflects a great deal of adaptability in creating and adopting different instruments, but it also reflects the limited capabilities of each particular instrument individually. Even when each source can supply only a limited amount of capital, borrowers often do not use them to the fullest extent possible, despite seemingly substantial overlap in the services provided by each instrument. Encouraging the creation of new financial instruments to cover unmet demands is a patchwork solution to these problems. It would be useful to understand what underlying rigidities prevent some products from substituting for others. Such an understanding would both help in developing new instruments and potentially allow for more direct corrections to the underlying financing challenges faced by the poor. For example, for unexpected consumption expenditures, there is an inherent importance in having fast access to funds. If a household member experiences a sudden illness, accident, or pregnancy complication, receiving immediate hospital care will often require  substantial upfront payments. Microfinance clients may be able to obtain funds on a regular schedule for business investments, but not necessarily for immediate health expenditures.",Open Access,,"Hornbeck, Richard",,25812.cpd,25811,,,,,,2015-04-16,2015-04-16,,,,,"IFPRI1

700,"Index-based insurance is an innovative financial product that has been introduced in recent years in countries as diverse as India, Malawi, Mongolia, and Thailand. It allows individual smallholder farmers to hedge against agricultural production risks, such as droughts or floods. The product pays out in events that are triggered by a publicly observable index, such as rainfall recorded on a local rain gauge. As a result, advocates argue that payouts can be calculated and disbursed quickly and automatically without the need for households to formally file a claim. This arrangement in turn reduces transaction costs, which would otherwise tend to drive up the price of the insurance. Fast payouts are also likely to be valued by policyholders in an environment where households are poor and often liquidity-constrained. Finally, the insurance product is free of adverse selection and moral hazard problems that often plague insurance markets because payouts are based only on publicly observed data rather than on private information reported by the person filing claims. Index-based insurance appears, therefore, to hold significant promise for rural households. Weather shocks to agricultural income generate fluctuations in household consumption that are not perfectly insured; at the extreme, they may lead to famine or death. Indeed, plenty of evidence suggests that households in developing countries are only partially insured and may thus avoid more profitable but riskier investments. Despite the benefits of index-based insurance, there are also some concerns. First, the product pays depending on the realization of an index, not on the actual crop yield or income of the farmer. Crop yields will relate to the index in complex ways that depend on soil moisture, evaporation, soil type, water runoff, and a variety of other factors. A good product will be one that maximizes the correlation between the index and what the client cares about. A variety of factors may discourage participation, such as household credit constraints, limited understanding of the product among potential consumers, limited trust in the insurance provider, or high transaction costs that raise the price of insurance. In a 2007 study on southern India by Giné, Townsend, and Vickery, the ratio of expected payouts on rainfall index insurance relative to premiums was estimated at only around 30 percent on average, compared with expected payouts equal to 65–76 percent of premiums for automobile and homeowners’ insurance in the United States. This relatively low payout rate may reflect a number of factors, including a lack of economies of scale given the small initial market for the product and the fact that the market is still in its infancy. More important in India, however, is the fact that high weather insurance payouts are correlated with poor macroeconomic conditions because of the dependence of the Indian economy on agriculture and the monsoon. These properties of insurance contracts are problematic to an insurer from a risk-management perspective. If rainfall insurance were written at a large scale, underwriters could limit their risk exposure by selling part of their rainfall risk to a reinsurer or by holding a significant capital buffer against potential losses. But both of these options are likely to be costly because of transaction costs, informational frictions, and tax concerns. The pros and cons of these types of products raise an important set of interrelated questions: What types of households buy index insurance? What factors prevent the remaining households from participating? And does the purchase of index insurance result in more efficient risk taking?",Open Access,,"Giné, Xavier",,22038.cpd,22037,,,,,,2017-06-28,2017-06-28,,,,,"IFPRI1

At an aggregate level it contributes to about 7 percent of Ghana’s GDP and more than 40 percent to the agricultural GDP (Aning et al. 2008). Within the livestock sector, poultry comprising chicken, ducks, guinea fowls, turkeys, and ostrich constitutes an integral part of the rural farming system. Though Ghana has some commercial and semi commercial large farms, most poultry production – an estimated 60 to 80 percent – takes place at a smaller scale, where chickens are free range with minimal use of purchased inputs. Ghana also imports poultry. Poultry meat imports, particularly chicken, have increased more than four times between 2000 and 2005, and they account for around 75 percent of total consumption (Aning et al. 2008).",Open Access,,"Schmitz, Christoph

Eighty percent of the national poultry population is managed in small-scale, non- or semi-commercial, village, or backyard poultry systems (MOLFD 2007).

The few studies on the role of poultry in Kenyan livelihoods suggest that poultry plays an important role in the livelihoods of small-scale poultry producers, contributing to their incomes, wealth, insurance against shocks, diet quality, culture, religion, and tradition (Njenga 2005; Kimani et al. 2006).",Open Access,,"Ndirangu, Lydia

716,"Even with abundant evidence of the urgent need for action on climate change mitigation, there are still those who consider mitigation strategies a burden. In the agricultural sector, climate change mitigation calls for changing some agricultural and resource management practices and technologies and often requires additional investment. However, there is an opportunity in agriculture for net benefit streams from a variety of zero- or low-cost mitigation opportunities ranging from agroforestry practices and restoration of degraded soils to zero-till and other land-management practices. Momentum has been generated to incorporate agriculture into carbon markets, potentially allowing smallholder farmers to access benefit streams from such transactions. However, who will receive the benefits from mitigation funds by, for example, increasing carbon stocks or reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land, will depend on the way different types of property rights are defined and dealt with in the upcoming climate change negotiations in Copenhagen. In many areas of the world, land tenure arrangements are complex. For example, in Africa, more than 90 percent of the land is formally claimed as state land, although millions of farming and pastoralist households use various customary and informal arrangements to access the land and other resources. Millions of hectares of forest and pastoral land in Asia and Latin America are similarly listed as state land, although used by communities, especially those of indigenous people or other marginalized ethnic groups. Often the same area may be under co-existing informal tenure systems, most of which are not recognized by formal land laws, but are instead accepted and enforced by the communities. Even where property rights are vested in a formal legal system with strong enforcement procedures, climate change mitigation measures raise new issues of who owns incremental carbon stocks and who should receive compensation for reductions in GHG emissions.",Open Access,,"Markelova, Helen

718,"Rice is grown on more than 140 million hectares worldwide and is the most heavily consumed staple food on earth. Ninety percent of the world’s rice is produced and consumed in Asia, and 90 percent of rice land is—at least temporarily—flooded. The unique semiaquatic nature of the rice plant allows it to grow productively in places no other crop could exist, but it is also the reason for its emissions of the major greenhouse gas (GHG), methane. Methane emissions from rice fields are determined mainly by water regime and organic inputs, but they are also influenced by soil type, weather, tillage management, residues, fertilizers, and rice cultivar. Flooding of the soil is a prerequisite for sustained emissions of methane. Recent assessments of methane emissions from irrigated rice cultivation estimate global emissions for the year 2000 at a level corresponding to 625 million metric tons (mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). Midseason drainage (a common irrigation practice adopted in major rice growing regions of China and Japan) and intermittent irrigation (common in northwest India) greatly reduce methane emissions. Similarly, rice environments with an insecure supply of water, namely rainfed rice, have a lower emission potential than irrigated rice. Organic inputs stimulate methane emissions as long as fields remain flooded. Therefore, organic inputs should be applied to aerobic soil in an effort to reduce methane emission. In addition to management factors, methane emissions are also affected by soil parameters and climate.",Open Access,,"Wassmann, Reiner

Ethiopia has not yet experienced an HPAI outbreak but has experienced a scare. An HPAI outbreak would cause a supply and demand shock to the poultry sector. Whereas supply shocks would be related directly to the disease and be local, demand shocks would be more dispersed across regions. Results of a dynamic spatially disaggregated multimarket model indicate that, given the poultry sector’s small contribution to the Ethiopian economy, the likely overall effect of an HPAI outbreak on the economy would be small. Importantly, for the same reason that aggregate impacts are likely to be small, the livelihood impact could be large, because poor households participate significantly in poultry production.",Open Access,,"Thomas, Marcelle

At an aggregate level it contributes to about 7 percent of Ghana’s GDP and more than 40 percent to the agricultural GDP (Aning et al. 2008). Within the livestock sector, poultry comprising chicken, ducks, guinea fowls, turkeys, and ostrich constitutes an integral part of the rural farming system. Though Ghana has some commercial and semi commercial large farms, most poultry production – an estimated 60 to 80 percent – takes place at a smaller scale, where chickens are free range with minimal use of purchased inputs. Ghana also imports poultry. Poultry meat imports, particularly chicken, have increased more than four times between 2000 and 2005, and they account for around 75 percent of total consumption (Aning et al. 2008).",Open Access,,"Schmitz, Christoph

729,"Index-based insurance is an innovative financial product that has been introduced in recent years in countries as diverse as India, Malawi, Mongolia, and Thailand. It allows individual smallholder farmers to hedge against agricultural production risks, such as droughts or floods. The product pays out in events that are triggered by a publicly observable index, such as rainfall recorded on a local rain gauge. As a result, advocates argue that payouts can be calculated and disbursed quickly and automatically without the need for households to formally file a claim. This arrangement in turn reduces transaction costs, which would otherwise tend to drive up the price of the insurance. Fast payouts are also likely to be valued by policyholders in an environment where households are poor and often liquidity-constrained. Finally, the insurance product is free of adverse selection and moral hazard problems that often plague insurance markets because payouts are based only on publicly observed data rather than on private information reported by the person filing claims. Index-based insurance appears, therefore, to hold significant promise for rural households. Weather shocks to agricultural income generate fluctuations in household consumption that are not perfectly insured; at the extreme, they may lead to famine or death. Indeed, plenty of evidence suggests that households in developing countries are only partially insured and may thus avoid more profitable but riskier investments. Despite the benefits of index-based insurance, there are also some concerns. First, the product pays depending on the realization of an index, not on the actual crop yield or income of the farmer. Crop yields will relate to the index in complex ways that depend on soil moisture, evaporation, soil type, water runoff, and a variety of other factors. A good product will be one that maximizes the correlation between the index and what the client cares about. A variety of factors may discourage participation, such as household credit constraints, limited understanding of the product among potential consumers, limited trust in the insurance provider, or high transaction costs that raise the price of insurance. In a 2007 study on southern India by Giné, Townsend, and Vickery, the ratio of expected payouts on rainfall index insurance relative to premiums was estimated at only around 30 percent on average, compared with expected payouts equal to 65–76 percent of premiums for automobile and homeowners’ insurance in the United States. This relatively low payout rate may reflect a number of factors, including a lack of economies of scale given the small initial market for the product and the fact that the market is still in its infancy. More important in India, however, is the fact that high weather insurance payouts are correlated with poor macroeconomic conditions because of the dependence of the Indian economy on agriculture and the monsoon. These properties of insurance contracts are problematic to an insurer from a risk-management perspective. If rainfall insurance were written at a large scale, underwriters could limit their risk exposure by selling part of their rainfall risk to a reinsurer or by holding a significant capital buffer against potential losses. But both of these options are likely to be costly because of transaction costs, informational frictions, and tax concerns. The pros and cons of these types of products raise an important set of interrelated questions: What types of households buy index insurance? What factors prevent the remaining households from participating? And does the purchase of index insurance result in more efficient risk taking?",Open Access,,"Giné, Xavier",,22038.cpd,22037,,,,,,2017-06-28,2017-06-28,,,,,"IFPRI1

736,"""There are no easy solutions to the ongoing food price crisis. Maize and wheat prices doubled between 2003 and 2008, and the price of rice doubled in the first four months of 2008, rising 33 percent in a single day. Even with declines in food prices later in 2008, prices remain well above 2000–2005 levels. To address the complex causes of this phenomenon, IFPRI has recommended a combination of “emergency” and “resilience” actions. One of the proposed policies emphasizes the need to boost agricultural production. This “emergency” agriculture package requires carefully targeted subsidies to ensure increases in production of major foodcrops (rice, wheat, and maize) in favorable environments with good soils, moisture, and market infrastructure. Following the Green Revolution model, delivery of improved varieties of seed, fertilizers, and other inputs, along with targeted, short-term subsidies, would augment production through higher yields rather than area expansion, so that scarce land can be reserved for other crops and uses. As part of the “resilience” package, IFPRI proposes scaled-up investment in agricultural growth to bolster production responses over the longer term. Until recently, public complacency regarding food abundance has contributed to a prolonged decline in agricultural investment by aid donors and developing-country governments. In-depth field research—undertaken by IFPRI with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and other partners in India, Kenya, and Mali—brings to light new evidence about farmers’ access to seed and the role of village markets in supplying it, with a focus on semi-arid environments. The findings point to several policy options aimed at improving the effectiveness of these markets, which can be crucial for reducing the potential negative impacts of high food prices. Such options might be considered in tandem with those recommended for more favorable environments, where seed systems already function more effectively. This brief introduces the issues that drove this research project, relevant concepts, and methods. The accompanying briefs present findings of specific country case studies."" -- from text",Open Access,,"Smale, Melinda

The study paid special attention to the gender dimension of service delivery. The research was conducted in eight districts located in seven administrative regions of Ethiopia, combining quantitative surveys with a qualitative case study approach. Empirical findings show that access to safe drinking water is rather low: 32% of the surveyed households use safe drinking water sources, and the average time to fetch water from safe sources during the dry season ranged from 29 minutes to 82 minutes. Agricultural extension services were relatively accessible, but there were differences in access between men and women, and particularly stark differences across the survey sites in different regions.

738,"While some African countries have not yet experienced outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), they remain vulnerable, both in terms of susceptibility and potential economic losses. Kenya is one of these vulnerable countries. Its position along migratory bird routes and proximity to other high risk countries make Kenya particularly susceptible to a potential HPAI outbreak. The threat of avian flu has caused many households in Kenya to limit their consumption of poultry products and the Kenyan government has also banned poultry imports (Nyaga, 2007; Omiti and Okuthe, 2009). Thus, even without a confirmed outbreak, avian flu may undermine the poultry sector with adverse impacts on agricultural livelihoods.",Open Access,,"Thurlow, James",,125008.pdf,125007,,,,,,2011-11-04,2016-04-28,,,,,IFPRI2,MTID,,http://www.ifpri.org/publication/assessing-impact-avian-flu-impact-kenya,,,,English,,780396879,"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3414-374X Thurlow, James",Non-PR,7 pages,"Washington, D.C.",,"International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

In Nigeria, peak HPAI outbreaks in February 2006 and February 2007 affected 3,057 farms and farmers; 1.3 million of the country’s 140 million birds were destroyed, and the Nigerian government paid US$5.4 million in compensation (FDL 2008). Still, policymakers may overlook some HPAI impacts, focusing upstream of the producer, whereas cumulative downstream (traders, slaughterhouses, retailers, casual employment, and support services) impacts often dwarf those at the farm level. More significantly, the failure to capture these diverse impacts may have important implications for disease evolution and control that may accentuate its impact.",Open Access,,"Akinwumi, James

740,"Risk is pervasive in developing countries. The standard household risks of sickness, mortality, fire, theft, and unemployment are especially severe for poor families in developing countries. Rural households, most of which derive their livelihoods from the land, face the additional risks of droughts, floods, and pests and diseases affecting their crops and livestock. Insurance provision is still limited, and state-provided social security or more basic social safety nets are often limited or unavailable for particular widespread disasters. Richer families have reasonable access to insurance alternatives, such as credit and substantial savings. Although these alternatives are generally not options for poorer families, it is well known that such families do employ relatively sophisticated mechanisms to manage and cope with risk. They tend to diversify their crops and income-generating activities, often incorporating nonfarm activities into their income streams and even having family members migrate to reduce the household’s overall exposure to risk. Where possible, they build up savings for precautionary purposes, often in the form of livestock or other liquid assets. They also engage in informal mutual support networks in which assistance is provided if a member experiences some form of shock. Nevertheless, given the variety and severity of risks to be dealt with, shocks inevitably have serious welfare consequences. These consequences are well illustrated by evidence from Ethiopia, where rural households face a considerable risk of drought. For example, about half of the households interviewed in 2004 for a rural panel data survey in 15 communities across the country reported that they faced serious hardship due to drought in the preceding five years, while about a quarter of the sample reported hardship resulting from illness and a similar number reported problems related to illness. Despite increased investment in health services and a relatively widespread, foreign aid–supported safety net to cope with drought, these shocks continue to impose significant welfare costs. The consumption levels of those reporting a serious drought, for example, were found to be 16 percent lower than those of families not affected, and shocks from illness appeared to have similar average impacts. Further, the costs were not just short term: in the sample, it was found that those who had suffered considerably in the 1984–85 famine—the most severe famine in recent history—were still experiencing lower growth rates in consumption in the 1990s, a period of overall recovery, than those who were not seriously affected by the famine. Children born during the famine were found to be up to three centimeters shorter at adulthood than children born before or after the famine, suggesting that famine had serious, persistent health impacts with long-term consequences. Risk should thus be seen as a cause of persistent poverty, in that shocks cause serious losses of physical assets and human capital. The presence of risk also tends to induce poorer households to become risk averse, even at the expense of otherwise higher returns: for example, they may choose to grow low-returning but safe crops and to avoid committing resources to more productive capital in order to preserve the liquidity of their asset base. In Ethiopia, efforts to increase farmers’ fertilizer use and thereby raise their productivity—a risky undertaking as farmers must still bear the costs of fertilizer even if the harvest fails—are significantly undermined by the lack of protection against poor rainfall. Evidence from other countries shows similar patterns: risk induces farmers to engage in low-return investment portfolios in rural India and to grow more low-risk, low-return crops such as sweetpotatoes or cassava in Tanzania. Climate and other shocks have been shown to undermine long-term nutrition, educational achievement, and earnings in settings as diverse as India, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. These studies all show that risk causes poverty to persist.",Open Access,,"Dercon, Stefan",,28245.cpd,28244,,,,,,2015-04-16,2015-04-16,,,,,"IFPRI1

In February 2006, Kaduna state in Nigeria was the first of 36 states to report the infection of poultry by H5N1 (Monne et al. 2008). By April 2006, more than 325,000 chickens in Nigeria alone were identified as having H5N1 virus; of these, 223,000 died of H5N1 infection and the rest were slaughtered as a control measure (You and Diao 2007). Since 2006, the infection has spread to 22 states in Nigeria (Monne et al. 2008), and there was recently one confirmed case in humans in the southern state of Lagos in February 2007 (Monne et al. 2008).

743,"""Agriculture and rural development must play a central role in stimulating economic growth, reducing poverty, and improving food and nutrition security in Africa. The food price crisis of 2007–08 highlighted the dramatic implications of world neglect of agricultural development over the past two decades. The current global economic recession now underscores the need for urgent attention to measures that could promote agricultural growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. Agriculture in Africa has not performed as well as expected during the past few decades. Agricultural growth rates in the region have increased modestly from about 2.4 percent a year in 1980–89 to 2.7 percent in 1990–99 and 3.3 percent a year since 2000.1 Only a handful of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa—Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, and The Gambia—have surpassed the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) threshold of 6 percent agricultural growth in recent years. Looking at poverty outcomes, whereas many developing regions, especially Asia and the Pacific, are on track to meet the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG 1) of halving poverty by 2015, progress in Sub-Saharan Africa has been slow. As a result, Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region of the developing world expected to have more poor people in 2015 than it did in 1990. Public spending is one of the most direct and effective instruments that governments can use to promote agricultural growth and poverty reduction, yet public agricultural spending in Africa has historically been very low compared with that in other developing regions. In recent years many Sub-Saharan African countries have pledged to increase government support to agriculture in order to achieve the goal of 6 percent annual agricultural growth, set by the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) through CAADP. As part of the Maputo Declaration of 2003, African heads of state agreed to allocate 10 percent of their national budgets to agriculture. Yet many African governments are operating in an environment of scarce public resources, and so far only a few states have met these growth and spending targets. As African governments work to increase agricultural spending and boost agricultural growth, they face a dearth of information about which types of public investments contribute the most to development goals. How should scarce resources be allocated across different sectors of the economy—such as agriculture, infrastructure, health, and education—for maximizing development outcomes? Within agriculture, how should resources be allocated among, for instance, agricultural research, extension, irrigation, and input subsidies? In some cases African countries have clear principles on how to prioritize their scarce public resources, but they often lack the information needed to operationalize these principles. Drawing mainly on case studies from Africa, but also from Asia, this brief provides insights on the contributions of different types of spending to poverty, growth, and welfare outcomes in a variety of circumstances. These circumstances include, for example, Ethiopia’s relatively large share of public spending allocated to agriculture, Nigeria’s rich natural resource endowments, Ghana’s relatively sound governance environment, Uganda’s past success in economic growth and poverty reduction, and Tanzania’s rapid transition from a planned to a market-driven economy."" -- from Author's text",Open Access,,"Fan, Shenggen

The costs of adapting agriculture to climate change can be large and the methods not always well known. Mitigation efforts will require information, education, and technology transfer. Agricultural extension and advisory services, both public and private, thus have a major role to play in providing farmers with information, technologies, and education on how to cope with climate change and ways to contribute to GHG mitigation. This support is especially important for resource-scarce smallholders, who contribute little to climate change and yet will be among the most affected.

746,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils are responsible for about 3 percent of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which cause climate change, and contribute approximately one-third of non-CO2 agricultural GHG emissions. N2O is produced by microbial transformations of nitrogen in the soil, under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Therefore, emissions are often directly related to nutrients added to the soil in the form of mineral fertilizers and animal manure. These additions can be vital in maintaining soil fertility and crop production; about half of the world’s population is dependent on food produced strictly because of mineral fertilizer inputs. However, the additions are also highly inefficient, leading to nitrogen losses via leaching, volatilization, and emissions to the atmosphere. By helping to maximize crop-nitrogen uptake, improved nutrient management has a significant and cost-effective role to play in mitigating GHG emissions from agriculture. Nutrient management can also help reduce methane (CH4) emissions from rice production and increase carbon sequestration in agricultural soils.",Open Access,,"Flynn, Helen C.",,31341.cpd,31340,,,,,,2015-03-12,2015-03-12,,,,,"IFPRI1

Increased pressures on natural resources, water scarcity, export restrictions imposed by major producers when food prices were high, and growing distrust in the functioning of regional and global markets have pushed countries short in land and water to find alternative means of producing food. These land acquisitions have the potential to inject much-needed investment into agriculture and rural areas in poor developing countries, but they also raise concerns about the impacts on poor local people, who risk losing access to and control over land on which they depend. It is crucial to ensure that these land deals, and the environment within which they take place, are designed in ways that will reduce the threats and facilitate the opportunities for all parties involved."" -- from Author's text",Open Access,,"von Braun, Joachim

752,"""The food price crisis of 2007–08 had several causes—rising demand for food, the change in the food equation through biofuels, climate change, high oil prices—but there is substantial evidence that the crisis was made worse by the malfunctioning of world grain markets. Dozens of countries imposed restrictions on grain exports that resulted in significant price increases, given the thinness of markets for major cereals. A number of countries adopted retail price controls, creating perverse incentives for producers. Speculative price spikes built up, and the gap between spot and futures prices widened, stimulating overregulation and trader policing in some countries and causing some commodity exchanges in Africa and Asia to halt grain futures trading. Some food aid donors defaulted on food aid contracts. The World Food Programme (WFP) had difficulty getting access to enough grain quickly for its humanitarian operations. Developing countries began urgently rebuilding their national stocks and reexamining the “merits” of self-sufficiency policies for food security. These reactions began as consequences, not causes, of the price crisis, but they exacerbated the crisis and increased the risks posed by high prices. By creating a positive feedback loop with high food prices, they took on a life of their own, increasing price levels and price volatility even more, with adverse consequences for the poor and for long-term incentives for agricultural production. Because they impeded the free flow of food to where it is most needed and the free flow of price signals to farmers, these market failures imposed enormous efficiency losses on the global food system, hitting the poorest countries hardest. Changes in supply and demand fundamentals cannot fully explain the recent drastic increase in food prices. Rising expectations, speculation, hoarding, and hysteria also played a role in the increasing level and volatility of food prices. The flow of speculative capital from financial investors into agricultural commodity markets has been drastic, and the number of future traded contracts is increasing over time. From May 2007 to May 2008, the volume of globally traded grain futures and options rose significantly. Excessive speculation in the commodity futures market could, in principle, push up futures prices and— through arbitrage opportunities—spot prices above levels justified by supply and demand fundamentals. The supposed impact of speculation is sometimes confused, however, with the impact of hedging, which reflects consumers’ genuine concerns about future fundamentals and desire to hedge against risks. This brief analyzes the role of financial speculation in the behavior of agricultural prices in recent years."" -- from text",Open Access,,"Robles, Miguel

753,"""Issues concerning farmers with small land holdings figure prominently in global discussions about poverty reduction, as the majority of the world's poor belong to such households. Most of these households are linked to the market in one way or another. Thus, the opportunity for smallholders to raise their incomes from agricultural production, natural resource management, and related rural enterprises increasingly depends on their ability to sell their goods not just at local, but also regional and even international markets. Agricultural producers in the developing world face significant challenges as a result of changing economic, environmental, and sociopolitical conditions. Changes in the global agricultural economy are providing smallholders with new opportunities that also present new constraints. The demand for higher value and processed foods as well as the rise of supermarkets around the world has implications for the entire food marketing system as it alters procurement systems and introduces new quality and safety standards. For example, European supermarket chains have imposed stringent food safety requirements such as GLOBALGAP on their suppliers of horticultural products, making it more challenging for farmers to supply these outlets. Smallholders also face significant challenges that hinder their participation in new marketing opportunities. Markets in the developing world are characterized by pervasive imperfections such as lack of information on prices and technologies, high transaction costs, and credit constraints. Moreover, the new procurement systems often expect larger supply volumes, favoring larger farmers. With the increasing number of free trade agreements affecting both national and international commodity markets, smallholder farmers are forced to compete not only with their local peers, but also with farmers from other countries as well as domestic and international agribusinesses. There is increasing evidence from both research and practice that one way for smallholders to overcome market failures and maintain their market position is through organizing into farmer groups or producers organizations. Acting collectively, smallholders would be better positioned to reduce transaction costs for their market exchanges, obtain necessary market information, secure access to new technologies, and tap into high-value markets, allowing them to compete more effectively with large farmers and agribusinesses. Producer groups can simplify long marketing chains by connecting smallholders directly to markets, bypassing various marketing intermediaries."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Markelova, Helen

In 2008, agriculture contributed 42 percent of the country's GDP, significantly higher than the 18 percent derived from petroleum and natural gas production. However, the country's promising agricultural potential has not been realized. In all likelihood, low fertilizer use is a major factor in explaining the stagnant agricultural productivity in Nigeria. Widespread introduction of fertilizer began in the late 1970s with the proliferation of Agricultural Development Projects (ADPs).

757,"""Every day, millions of rural people who depend on agriculture confront technical, economic, social, cultural, and traditional obstacles to improving their livelihoods. To cope with these obstacles, the rural poor draw on indigenous knowledge and innovate through local experimentation and adaptation. Indigenous knowledge alone, however, is not enough to deal with the complex problems facing the agricultural sector. Emerging issues such as high food prices, climate change, and demands for biofuels require complementary knowledge from formal agricultural research and development (R&D) and support from policies and other institutions. Formal and informal knowledge and innovation must therefore be linked to accelerate sustainable agricultural development. Knowledge, defined as organized or processed information or data, is fundamental in the pursuit of innovation. For innovation to occur, knowledge must be created, accumulated, shared, and used. Innovations—new ideas, practices, or products that are successfully introduced into economic or social processes— can involve technologies, organizations, institutions, or policies.

758,"Microinsurance is a powerful tool in helping low-income households transition out of poverty, but it has not achieved substantial scale compared with microcredit. In India, microfinance institutions (MFIs) initially showed great potential in offering microinsurance through in-house provision (the mutual model) or as agents for mainstream microinsurance companies (the partner– agent model). Over time, however, both models revealed significant flaws. The mutual model appeared limited because the community absorbs all the risk, and the partner–agent model experienced severe implementation issues, causing many large MFIs in India to scale back its use. The microinsurance industry is battling the challenges of an infant industry—challenges made more severe by the difficulty of providing high-quality services at a price that the target population is willing to pay. Yet slow progress and the experiences of a few MFIs offer hope that MFIs can become a suitable delivery channel for microinsurance products. This brief examines the merits of providing microinsurance through MFIs in light of the challenges faced by the microinsurance industry.

759,"From 2006 to the present, 11 countries in Africa reported outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1: Egypt, Sudan, Djibouti, Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Cameroon. Other than Egypt, where the disease is endemic, the last cases of HPAI H5N1 in Africa reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) occurred in Nigeria (June and July 2008) and Togo (September 2008). In Indonesia, the disease has become endemic since its introduction in 2004. Qualitative risk assessment is the most common type of assessment to guide routine decisionmaking, especially in data-scarce environments. It allows for the development of risk mitigation strategies and for the identification of data gaps, and provides useful recommendations for future research. A joint research team from the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in London and International Livestock Research institute (ILRI) in Nairobi led five qualitative risk assessments in Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Indonesia between October 2008 and June 2009. The work was carried out by national collaborators: Paa Kobina Turkson (Ghana), Bewket Siraw and Hassen Chaka (Ethiopia), Dennis Onkundi (Kenya), Garba Maina Ahmed (Nigeria), and Syafrison Idris and Maria F. Palupi (Indonesia). In each of the five countries, a stakeholders workshop was held in October or November 2008. These workshops had three main objectives: to present the risk assessment objectives to the stakeholders; to define the risk questions of interest for each country; and to outline the risk pathways. Drawing on the workshop outcomes, the risk assessments (RAs) were then conducted from January to April 2009. Given the scarcity of data in these environments, input data for the models were collected by expert opinion elicitation, with key informants responding to questionnaires. The RA reports are currently being finalized.",Open Access,,"Métras, Raphaëlle

760,"Climate change will bring with it increased frequency of two types of natural disasters that affect agriculture and rural households: droughts and floods. It will also alter rainfall patterns, thereby changing farming practices, household behavior, and welfare. Households all over the world use a variety of formal and informal mechanisms to manage risk and cope with unexpected events that negatively affect incomes, assets, or well-being. These mechanisms include both preparation for and responses to natural disasters. In low-income settings, where formal insurance and government supports are limited, households tend to rely on informal coping strategies, such as transfers from friends and neighbors, remittances, or investments in a diverse range of assets, from livestock to human capital. When disaster-related shock affects only a few households at a time, informal mechanisms can be quite effective in dealing with the situation. However, if the shock affects large areas simultaneously, small-scale coping mechanisms become ineffective. Research on several climate-related national disasters-the 1998 floods in Bangladesh, the 2001 drought in Ethiopia, and the 2001-02 failed maize harvest in Malawi-suggests that the upcoming negotiations in Copenhagen need to explicitly define, support, and expand policies that protect vulnerable populations from the expected increase in climate-change related weather events.",Open Access,,"Yamauchi, Futoshi

However, agricultural research and higher education are disproportionately led by men. There is an urgent need for a greater representation of women in the field of agricultural science and technology (S&T) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Female scientists, professors, and senior managers offer different insights and perspectives to help research institutes to more fully address the unique and pressing challenges of both female and male farmers in the region. Gender-disaggregated data on S&T capacity are scarce, often lack sufficient detail, and focus more generally on S&T rather than on agriculture specifically.

In many cases, farmers also confront the risk of catastrophe, as, for example, when crops are destroyed by drought or pest outbreaks or when assets and lives are lost to hurricanes and floods. These risks are particularly burdensome to the poor, including many small farmers. Unless adequately managed, they can slow economic development and poverty reduction and contribute to humanitarian crises. Covariate risks, especially those that involve catastrophic losses, pose special difficulties and costs.

However, the frequency of heat stress, drought, and flooding are also expected to increase, even though they cannot be modeled satisfactorily with current climate models. They will undoubtedly have adverse effects on crops and agricultural productivity over and above the effects due to changes in mean variables alone. The impacts of climate change on agriculture are likely to be regionally distinct and highly heterogeneous spatially, requiring sophisticated understanding of causes and effects and careful design and dissemination of appropriate responses. These changes will challenge the livelihoods of farmers, fishers, and forest-dependent people who are already vulnerable and food insecure. Adapting to these changes, while continuing to feed a world of 9 billion people, requires the formation of a global partnership in science, technology development, and dissemination of results to millions of smallholder farmers, bringing together research workers and resource managers from many fields.

The data collected include the range and quantity of crops and livestock produced; the amount of land put to crop or livestock production; how the agricultural production is used, whether for own consumption or marketed; the farming systems employed; and the socio-economic conditions of farming households. In Uganda, there are several agencies involved in the collection of various food and agricultural statistics (FAS) led by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF). However, currently very few agricultural statistics are collected on an annual basis at national and sub-national levels. Among the most important statistics for which there is no regular and current information are crop area, yield, and production. UBOS and MAAIF and their predecessor institutions have never succeeded in putting in place statistical systems to collect annual nationally representative agricultural production data. While attempts have been made in the past - for example, past agriculture censuses were followed with a few annual surveys - subsequently these systems broke down. The focus of this brief is the range of elements that must be addressed in planning for and building a sustainable, effective, and efficient FAS system to produce annual, spatially-disaggregated estimates of agricultural production in Uganda. These design issues include meeting the needs of a wide array of data users, assessing the trade-offs between several data collection and analysis methodologies, institutional arrangements, and ensuring sustained flows of adequate financial resources. Further, the characteristics of the agricultural systems in Uganda makes data collection more difficult due to mixed crop and livestock farming systems, continuous planting and harvesting, use of non-standard units of measure of output, few farmers recording their production, and nomadic pastoral livestock production in some areas, among others.",Open Access,,"Muwanga-Zake, E.S.K.",,15323.cpd,15322,,,,,,2022-08-05,2022-08-05,,,,,"IFPRI1

767,"""Rural residents across the developing world earn a large share of their income—35–50 percent—from nonfarm activities. Agricultural households count on nonfarm earnings to diversify risk, moderate seasonal income swings, and finance agricultural input purchases, whereas landless and near-landless households everywhere depend heavily on nonfarm income for their survival. Over time, the rural nonfarm economy has grown rapidly, contributing significantly to both employment and rural income growth. Long neglected by policymakers, the rural nonfarm economy has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In poor agrarian countries struggling with growing numbers of marginal farmers and lackluster agricultural performance, such as those in much of Africa, policymakers view the rural nonfarm economy as a potential alternative to agriculture for stimulating rural income growth. In countries whose economies are successfully shifting from agriculture to other sectors, policymakers see the rural nonfarm economy as a sector that can productively absorb the many agricultural workers and small farmers being squeezed out of agriculture by increasingly commercialized and capitalintensive modes of farming. Given frequently low capital requirements in the nonfarm economy, policymakers in both settings view the rural nonfarm economy as offering a potential pathway out of poverty for many of their rural poor. Expectations everywhere are high.  How realistic are these expectations? Can the rural nonfarm economy indeed grow rapidly enough to productively absorb a growing rural labor force? And in doing so, can it, in fact, provide a pathway out of poverty for the rural poor? A recent book published for IFPRI by Johns Hopkins University Press and Oxford University Press in India, Transforming the Rural Nonfarm Economy: Opportunities and Threats in the Developing World, marshals empirical evidence from around the globe to explore these key policy questions. The book, edited by Steven Haggblade, Peter B. R. Hazell, and Thomas Reardon, examines key factors affecting growth and equity in the rural nonfarm economy in order to identify settings and policies that favor rural nonfarm growth and enable the poor to participate in growing segments of the evolving rural nonfarm economy."" -- from text",Open Access,,"Haggblade, Steven

Given that 85 percent of the population depends on smallholder agriculture, these weather shocks severely affect many Ethiopians. The high covariance of climatic risks, coupled with the lack of property to be attached as collateral, makes it difficult for cooperatives, microfinance organizations, or banks to provide financial services to smallholder farmers unless they have some insurance/reinsurance against this weather risk. These conditions in turn keep farming at a subsistence level, with low use of improved technology, low productivity, and low risk.

In towns with electricity access, producers work longer hours by sharing workspaces with electric lights at lower rental cost, resulting in higher labor productivity.",Open Access,,"Ayele, Gezahegn

SPRI allows adjustment of irrigation schedules in accordance with observed crop needs. The irrigated area in Nigeria is, however, far below its potential and an increase in farmers’ investment in irrigation is essential. While Nigerian farmers’ low level of investment in irrigation may be partly due to low returns, it is also the result of high transaction costs associated specifically with making such an investment. Although reducing transaction costs is important because the reduction provides farmers with a more enabling environment, transaction costs are often unobservable and little is known about what factors contribute to them. This brief provides insights into how farmers’ socioeconomic characteristics relate to the transaction costs in irrigation pump investment. It also offers policy options to reduce such costs.",Open Access,,"Takeshima, Hiroyuki

771,"Uganda's economy remains heavily dependent on the agricultural sector. In 2008/09, the agricultural sector contributed 90 percent of total export earnings, generated 23.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and directly or indirectly provided livelihoods for about 90 percent of the population (MFPED, 2009). However, most of the agricultural production is by small-scale subsistence farmers who use rudimentary technology and are largely engaged in non-market production. The Plan for Modernisation of Agriculture (PMA) was, therefore, designed by the government of Uganda as a strategic framework for eradicating poverty through the implementation of multi-sectoral interventions aimed at easing the multifaceted constraints faced by farmers. Specifically, PMA is aimed at increasing income and quality of life, improving household food security, providing gainful employment, and providing sustainable use and management of resources. In support of PMA priority interventions, the Government of Uganda is implementing the Prosperity for All development framework that embraces rural enterprise and promotes industry by building on the Plan for Zonal Agricultural Production, Agro-processing and Marketing. Through zoning and enterprise selection criteria, PMA intends to provide information and guidance for agricultural investment to local governments and individual farmers at the agricultural production zone level (Figure 1). The International Food Policy Research Institute is assisting PMA in building capacity to target profitable types of enterprises. This study is aimed at providing information about the profitability of PMA priority enterprises in the 10 established agricultural zones of Uganda. The findings and recommendations provided here were obtained through analysis of the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS), the most frequently updated database on household economic activities in the country. This policy brief concludes with suggestions on how the UNHS could be improved to provide more accurate information on relative enterprise profitability in the future.",Open Access,,"Kraybill, David

772,"The agricultural sector in developing countries is particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Given Ethiopia's dependence on agriculture and natural resources, any adverse agricultural effects will pose serious risks to economic growth and livelihoods across the country. Soil and water conservation technologies have been suggested as a key adaptation strategy for developing countries, particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa, in light of increased water shortages, drought, desertification, and worsening soil conditions. According to a survey of 1,000 households in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia, more than 30 percent of farmers adopted soil and water conservation measures in response to perceived long-term changes in temperature and rainfall. Although soil and water conservation technologies are generally considered low-cost, they still engender risk for very low-income, risk-averse households, which are prevalent in rural Ethiopia. Thus, it is important to consider the impacts not only on crop yields, but also on risk levels. This brief is based on a study that investigates the risk implications of various soil and water conservation technologies for crop production in Ethiopia's Nile River Basin. The analysis identifies technologies that increase and decrease crop production risk-with risk defined as the degree of yield variability-for the purpose of isolating which technologies are best suited to particular regions and agroecological zones. These results could be used to improve the geographical targeting of soil conservation techniques as part of efforts to promote farm-level adaptation to climate change.",Open Access,,"Kato, Edward

773,"""The 2007–08 international food price crisis caused hardship on a  number of fronts. The steep rise in food prices led to economic difficulties for the poor and generated political turmoil in many countries. The crisis could also result in long-term, irreversible nutritional damage, especially among children. There is a global interest in preventing such events from recurring. The price crisis was triggered by a complex set of long-term and short-term factors, including policy failures and market overreactions. One important factor in the crisis was the entry of significant financial resources into futures markets, including food commodity markets, which contributed to a price spike during the first six months of 2008. This episode highlights the need to modify the architecture of international financial and agricultural markets to address the problem of price spikes, especially their effects on the livelihoods of the poor. Although a set of guiding principles for regulating agricultural and commodity futures markets should be developed and recent inappropriate trade policy instruments such as export bans should be reviewed, these actions are not sufficient to avoid extreme price spikes and to ensure that the world can respond to emergency needs for food. We propose two global collective actions to meet these goals. First, a small physical food reserve should be established to facilitate a smooth response to food emergencies. Second, an innovative virtual reserve should be set up to help prevent market price spikes and to keep prices closer to levels suggested by long-run market fundamentals like supply and demand. This brief offers some specifics on implementing a proposal described in our earlier IFPRI policy brief titled Physical and Virtual Global Food Reserves to Protect the Poor and Prevent Market Failure (June 2008). Price instability is a general feature of agricultural markets. The proposals made here are designed not to stabilize prices generally, but to prevent damaging price spikes. The proposed actions will entail costs, but the modest costs of the required organizational elements must be balanced against the benefits of more effective international financial architecture. These benefits will include prevention of economic hardship, improved market efficiency, stronger incentives for long-term investment in agriculture, and prevention of political instability."" -- from Author's text",Open Access,,"von Braun, Joachim

774,"The Mongolian rural economy is based on livestock reared by semi-nomadic herders. Agriculture contributes around 20 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, and herding accounts for more than 80 percent of agriculture. According to the 2008 livestock census, Mongolia has about 44 million head of livestock, consisting of goats, sheep, cattle, yaks, horses, and camels. Livestock provide sustenance, income, and wealth to nearly half the residents of Mongolia. Shocks to the well-being of livestock therefore have devastating implications for the rural poor and for the overall Mongolian economy. Major shocks are common because Mongolia has a harsh climate where animals are herded with limited shelter. From 2000 to 2002, harsh winters (dzud) killed 11 million animals. The Government of Mongolia has struggled with the obvious question of how to address this problem. Managing risk in the livestock sector requires a combination of risk mitigation and financial approaches. Pastoral risk mitigation, including winter shelters, fodder crop storage, and improved management of winter pastures, can help herders better prepare for moderate weather events. In extreme dzud events—that is, sudden-onset winter storms with very low temperatures, high winds, and heavy snow—high levels of livestock mortality are often unavoidable. Pastoral and herd management must therefore be complemented by financial mechanisms that provide herder households with immediate liquidity after a disaster. In 2001 the Government of Mongolia requested assistance from the World Bank to address the problem of frequent high death rates in the livestock population. Traditional indemnitybased livestock insurance (based on individual losses) has proved ineffective in Mongolia because of the high cost of covering animals spread across vast areas, ex ante moral hazard (herders failed to protect their livestock), and ex post moral hazard (herders falsely reported animal deaths). The World Bank recommended an index-based insurance program based on livestock mortality rates by species and soum (county), as well as a comprehensive riskfinancing strategy including self-insurance by herders, market-based insurance, and a social safety net. Index-based insurance can lower administrative costs and reduce moral hazard and adverse selection. Its main disadvantage is the presence of basis risk—that is, the index payout may not exactly match the individual livestock loss.",Open Access,,"Mahul, Olivier

Because agriculture depends heavily on rainfall, it is sensitive to weather changes. Agriculture is also vulnerable to extreme weather events; floods, droughts, and frosts cause both production and capital losses. Approximately 98 percent of the catastrophic risk to agriculture in Mexico stems from two types of weather events: droughts (accounting for 80 percent) and cyclones (accounting for 18 percent). Low-income rural populations are highly vulnerable to the harmful effects of weather, yet their access to insurance programs is almost nonexistent.",Open Access,,"González, Amado Villarreal",,23805.cpd,23804,,,,,,2017-06-28,2017-06-28,,,,,"IFPRI1

Since the transmission of HIV in the population is mainly through sexual activity, avoiding infection depends on risk-avoiding behavior. If the number of sexual partners is reduced after marriage, marriage may work as an institution to limit risks of HIV infection in society. This study undertook preliminary empirical assessment of recent panel data from South Africa. Results show that excess mortality is concentrated in unmarried adults aged 20–39 among both men and women (with a larger increase in mortality rate among women than men). Thus, the choice of when and who to marry appears to be related to risk of HIV exposure, leading to the authors to the primary question of this study; to determine the effect that schooling has on AIDS and excess mortality through changes in marriage behavior. This paper tests the hypothesis that schooling affects when one marries and thus impacts the risk of AIDS-related mortality.",Open Access,,"Yamauchi, Futoshi",,25806.cpd,25805,,,,,,2015-02-27,2015-02-27,,,,,"IFPRI1

The death of prime-age adults decreases household income and, thus, decreases investment in human capital for the next generation. For individuals, high prime-age adult mortality influences people’s perceptions on potential risks in family formation such as finding a marriage partner. For example, in a society where the AIDS epidemic is prevalent, a possible behavioral change in the marriage market in response to an increase in prime-age adult mortality is to marry earlier to avoid their exposure to HIV.

With likely long-term changes in rainfall patterns and shifting temperature zones, climate change is expected to significantly affect agricultural production, which could be detrimental to the region’s food security and economic growth. An assessment of the factors influencing farm-level adaptation can facilitate the formation of policies and investment strategies that help moderate potential adverse consequences of long-term climate change. Because smallholder farmers tend to have a low capacity to adapt to changes in climatic conditions, policies that help these farmers adapt to global warming and associated climatic extremes are particularly important. This brief is based on a study that assesses smallholder farmers’ adaptation to climate change in southern Africa. The study identifies farmers’ perceptions of climate change and the determinants of farm- evel adaptation strategies, and recommends policies that could help stabilize national and regional food production given the anticipated adverse effects of climate change.",Open Access,,"Yesuf, Mahmud

It constitutes more than half the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), generates more than 85 percent of the foreign exchange earnings, and employs about 80 percent of the population. Ethiopia’s dependence on agriculture makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change on crop and livestock production. This brief is based on a paper that analyzes the vulnerability of Ethiopian farmers to climate change by creating a vulnerability index and comparing vulnerability indicators across regions. A regional vulnerability index can assist in identifying the areas of Ethiopia that are most vulnerable to climate change and guide policymakers in determining where investments in adaptation may be most effective in reducing the future adverse effects of climate change.",Open Access,,"Deressa, Temesgen T.

790,"Community-based Natural Resource Management (NRM) is increasingly becoming an important approach for addressing natural resource degradation in low income countries. This study analyzes the determinants of enactment, awareness of and compliance with by-laws related to Natural Resource Management (NRM) in order to draw policy implications that could be used to increase the effectiveness of by-laws in managing natural resources sustainably.  We found a strong association between awareness and compliance with NRM bylaws. This suggests the need to promote environmental education as part of the strategy to increase compliance with NRM bylaws. Econometric analysis of the survey data indicates factors that are associated with enactment of local NRM bylaws, and awareness of and compliance with NRM requirements... These findings imply that improving awareness of NRM requirements is critical to increase compliance with such requirements. Awareness is greater in areas closer to all-weather roads, probably due to better access to information in such areas. Development of roads and communication can thus facilitate better community NRM. Other low cost options to increase awareness could include use of radio programs, environmental education in schools, resource user seminars, brochures, and district level training workshops...Several dimensions of poverty, including greater income poverty, poor education, and poor access to credit are associated with lower compliance with tree planting and protection requirements. This supports the hypothesis of a poverty-natural resource degradation trap, and suggests that measures to reduce poverty can have ""win-win"" benefits helping to improve NRM as well.--Author's Abstract",Open Access,,"Nkonya, Ephraim

Some studies found a positive correlation of HIV infection with socioeconomic status, but others found negative or insignificant relationship. Most existing studies did not explicitly pay attention to the fact that each study came from different countries (areas) at different stages of the epidemic. Because of data constraint, most studies examined �snapshots� of factors associated with HIV infection in a specific country during a specific time frame (e.g., Malawi 2000) using cross-sectional data. Very few studies focus on how infection factors change with the depth of the AIDS epidemic. In other words, previous studies have just made an attempt to �generalize� the relationship between education and HIV infection, assuming that the epidemic stage does not play a significant role.",Open Access,,"Ueyama, Mika",,17759.cpd,17758,,,,,,2022-08-04,2022-08-04,,,,,"IFPRI1

794,"""Governments in Asia used grain price stabilization as a major policy instrument when they began to promote the Green Revolution in the 1960s. In the process, they created parastatal agencies, which were quasi-governmental in nature, to undertake public marketing activities in basic staples such as rice and wheat. These operations often meant providing a support price to farmers, procuring staples on government account, holding public stocks, and distributing these stocks through public distribution systems or open market operations to hold the price line for consumers. This led to a sizeable degree of government intervention in most of these countries' grain markets, which continues to a large extent today."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Rashid, Shahidur

This study examines the impacts of adult deaths on child nutrition—specifically the impact on child food intake and growth with reference to their weights. Anthropometry data from five southern African countries are analyzed for this purpose, and we adopt new methods to investigate the impacts of (recent) adult deaths on short-run changes in child weight. If households face credit constraints, and their risk mitigating strategies do not ensure perfect smoothing of consumption, the death of adult members (who are likely income earners) can decrease consumption and therefore dietary intakes. Weight is a good measure of the nutritional status of children, and, because children are highly vulnerable members of the household, of the household’s welfare.",Open Access,,"Brunelli, Chiara

More than 15 years of rigorous research on gender and intrahousehold resource allocation suggest not only that men and women will be affected differently by the global food crisis, but also that, as both consumers and producers, they will have different stocks of resources with which to respond to rising prices. Although the current situation calls for an urgent national and international response, urgency is not an excuse for misguided policies that fail to address the gender implications of the crisis. Instead, decisionmakers should take this opportunity to incorporate what is known about women's roles in agricultural production and household welfare, and the specific challenges they face, both to craft more effective policy responses and to enable women to respond better to the current challenges and opportunities."" -- from Author's text",Open Access,,"Quisumbing, Agnes R.

803,"""Gender norms are an important constraint to increasing agricultural productivity. Inequality in the distribution of resources between men and women is linked with production inefficiency, yet interventions targeting smallholder farmers often fail to redress women's lack of access to, and control of, important agricultural resources. Women are often constrained in access to and control of land, water, and other natural resources; complementary inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer; new varieties and technologies; agricultural extension; labor; credit; markets; and social capital. Oftentimes, interventions will be designed to relieve one constraint, not realizing that gender norms-or constraints in other resources-are more binding and may affect the outcome of the intervention. Without specific attention to gender issues, programs and projects are likely to reinforce inequalities between women and men and may even increase resource imbalances. While individual projects cannot hope to redress these inequalities in the short term, at a minimum, interventions should do no harm, and ideally they should catalyze a change process for ending gender discrimination and securing women's access to key resources. This brief focuses on key agricultural resources needed by poor female farmers to generate incomes and ensure their families' food security. It is organized around key resources and promising approaches to increase poor women's control of those resources. One resource that is not included in this review is human capital. It must be emphasized that investing in women's education, health, and nutrition is an integral part of enabling women to guarantee their families-and their own-well-being. These approaches were identified in the course of a review of projects and interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. However, while many of these interventions are innovative, most of them have not been rigorously evaluated. Where evaluations have been done, little attention has been paid to the differential impacts on men and women, or to which delivery mechanisms may be more effective in reaching different groups of women and men. Many of the approaches were also pilot projects, and without evaluations it is difficult to recommend which of them should be scaled up. Nevertheless, this brief suggests many promising strategies for channeling resources into the hands of female farmers to boost their agricultural productivity."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Quisumbing, Agnes R.

At the same time, rising food prices provide an incentive and opportunity for many developing countries to strengthen the contribution their farmers make to national economic growth and poverty reduction. Policymakers and opinion leaders in developing countries, however, often lack sufficient information to gauge the likely effects of global food crises on their country and to identify, design, and implement policy actions that can best avoid risks and take advantage of opportunities. The deficiencies in information and analysis can lead to overand underreactions, resulting in policy and market failures. Experiences across countries in 2007 and 2008 show ample evidence of such outcomes. Although the food crisis information currently available is alarming and sufficient to initiate largescale action, the information base must be improved to make that action more effective.--From Text",Open Access,,"Benson, Todd

808,"Spatial analysis of the distribution of disease risk and its visual presentation through risk maps can be used to inform the design of animal disease surveillance resulting in more cost-effective strategies. It is suitable for application in the context of HPAI H5N1 in Africa and Indonesia where the disease has already been introduced and is endemic in some areas.; Two main approaches can be used to produce risk maps:; A data-driven approach, which uses actual disease data to identify risk factors that allow the absolute risk of disease occurrence in an area to be determined;;  A knowledge-driven approach, which uses knowledge about the epidemiology of the disease to identify areas at higher or lower risk of disease occurrence relative to the surrounding areas.; Both approaches are based on available evidence. However, when empirical data about the distribution of the disease are not readily available or when data are only available on some aspects of the epidemiology of a multi-factorial disease, knowledge-driven approaches can be used to determine those areas in which a specific disease is most likely to occur using models such as multicriteria decision modelling (MCDM) (Clements et al. 2006, Pfeiffer et al. 2008).; In contrast to data-driven modelling, MCDM does not generate estimates of absolute risk. Instead, MCDM generates maps that identify areas with a higher or lower likelihood of an event of interest occurring relative to surrounding areas on the same map. A study described in more detail in EDRS-AIA risk mapping documents (2009) was conducted using an MCDM approach to describe the spatial variation in the likelihood of: introduction and spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus HPAI H5N1 in Africa, and spread of HPAI H5N1 in Indonesia.; This brief summarizes the methodology used to produce the maps for continental Africa and Indonesia, and the findings. In addition to the three maps in this brief, maps for other African countries were produced and are presented in the report, Mapping the Likelihood of Introduction and Spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus H5N1 in Africa, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and Nigeria using Multicriteria Decision Modelling (Stevens et al. 2009); and maps for Indonesia can be found in Mapping the Risk of Spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 in Indonesia using Multicriteria Decision Modelling (de Glanville et al. 2009).

814,"""Governments in Asia used grain price stabilization as a major policy instrument when they began to promote the Green Revolution in the 1960s. In the process, they created parastatal agencies, which were quasi-governmental in nature, to undertake public marketing activities in basic staples such as rice and wheat. These operations often meant providing a support price to farmers, procuring staples on government account, holding public stocks, and distributing these stocks through public distribution systems or open market operations to hold the price line for consumers. This led to a sizeable degree of government intervention in most of these countries' grain markets, which continues to a large extent today."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Rashid, Shahidur

Some studies found a positive correlation of HIV infection with socioeconomic status, but others found negative or insignificant relationship. Most existing studies did not explicitly pay attention to the fact that each study came from different countries (areas) at different stages of the epidemic. Because of data constraint, most studies examined �snapshots� of factors associated with HIV infection in a specific country during a specific time frame (e.g., Malawi 2000) using cross-sectional data. Very few studies focus on how infection factors change with the depth of the AIDS epidemic. In other words, previous studies have just made an attempt to �generalize� the relationship between education and HIV infection, assuming that the epidemic stage does not play a significant role.",Open Access,,"Ueyama, Mika",,17759.cpd,17758,,,,,,2022-08-04,2022-08-04,,,,,"IFPRI1

816,"Community-based Natural Resource Management (NRM) is increasingly becoming an important approach for addressing natural resource degradation in low income countries. This study analyzes the determinants of enactment, awareness of and compliance with by-laws related to Natural Resource Management (NRM) in order to draw policy implications that could be used to increase the effectiveness of by-laws in managing natural resources sustainably.  We found a strong association between awareness and compliance with NRM bylaws. This suggests the need to promote environmental education as part of the strategy to increase compliance with NRM bylaws. Econometric analysis of the survey data indicates factors that are associated with enactment of local NRM bylaws, and awareness of and compliance with NRM requirements... These findings imply that improving awareness of NRM requirements is critical to increase compliance with such requirements. Awareness is greater in areas closer to all-weather roads, probably due to better access to information in such areas. Development of roads and communication can thus facilitate better community NRM. Other low cost options to increase awareness could include use of radio programs, environmental education in schools, resource user seminars, brochures, and district level training workshops...Several dimensions of poverty, including greater income poverty, poor education, and poor access to credit are associated with lower compliance with tree planting and protection requirements. This supports the hypothesis of a poverty-natural resource degradation trap, and suggests that measures to reduce poverty can have ""win-win"" benefits helping to improve NRM as well.--Author's Abstract",Open Access,,"Nkonya, Ephraim

819,"Human activities such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation have significantly increased the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) leading to global climate change. Global climate change and its associated weather extremes pose considerable challenges worldwide, and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change is a high priority for the international community. To reduce global emissions and curb the threat of climate change, many countries are participating in carbon trading. Carbon trading includes allowance-based agreements that impose national caps on emissions and allow participating countries to engage in emission trading as well as project-based transactions (for example, through the CDM or Clean Development Mechanism). The CDM allows industrialized countries with greenhouse gas reduction commitments to invest in emission-reducing projects in developing countries as an alternative to generally more costly emission reductions in their own countries. Funds made available by the CDM for carbon offsets provide an opportunity for cash-strapped developing countries to fund much needed adaptation measures. The potential annual value stream for Sub-Saharan Africa from mitigating GHG emissions is estimated to be US$4.8 billion at carbon prices of US$0–20/tCO2e. Moreover, agricultural mitigation measures, including soil and water conservation and agroforestry practices, also enhance ecosystem functioning, providing resilience against droughts, pests, and climate-related shocks. Yet the potential for Africa to contribute to global reductions in GHG emissions is quite substantial. Estimates suggest Africa could potentially contribute to GHG reductions of 265 MtCO2e (million tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent) per year at carbon prices of up to US$20 through agricultural measures and 1,925 MtCO2e/yr at carbon prices of up to US$100/tCO2e by 2030 through changes in the forestry sector. These amounts constitute 17 and 14 percent, respectively, of the global total potential for mitigation in these sectors. However, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are marginalized in global carbon markets. Sub-Saharan Africa’s share of the CDM market is nine times smaller than its global share of GHG emissions, including emissions from land use and land-use change. This brief is based on a paper that examines Sub-Saharan Africa’s current involvement in carbon markets, potential for GHG emission reductions, constraints to further participation in carbon markets, and opportunities for expanding Sub-Saharan Africa’s market share.",Open Access,,"Bryan, Elizabeth

The expiration of the U.S. president's trade negotiating authority on June 30, 2007, raised the prospect of longer delay. More recently, however, the unprecedented food crisis may have created an environment for reducing the divergences in countries' negotiating positions, and efforts for agreement have intensified at Geneva.

In view of the urgency of assisting people and countries in need, the first set of policy actions-an emergency package-consists of steps that can yield immediate impact:; 1. expand emergency responses and humanitarian assistance to food-insecure people andpeople threatening government legitimacy,; 2. eliminate agricultural export bans and export restrictions,; 3. undertake fast-impact food production programs in key areas, and; 4. change biofuel policies. A second set of actions-a resilience package-consists of the following steps:; 5. calm markets with the use of market-oriented regulation of speculation, shared public grain stocks, strengthened food-import financing, and reliable food aid;; 6. invest in social protection;; 7. scale up investments for sustained agricultural growth; and; 8. complete the Doha Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. Investment in these actions calls for additional resources. Policymakers should consider mobilizing resources from four sources: the winners from the commodity boom among countries; the community of traditional and new donor countries; direct or indirect progressive taxation and reallocation of public expenditures in the affected countries themselves; and mobilization of private sector finance, including through improved outreach of banking to agriculture. Because of countries' diverse situations, the design of programs must be country driven and country owned. Accountability for sound implementation must also rest with countries. At the same time, a new international architecture for the governance of agriculture, food, and nutrition is needed to effectively implement the initiatives described, and especially their international public goods components.

822,"The community-driven development (CDD) approach has become increasingly popular because of its potential to develop projects that are sustainable, are responsive to local priorities, empower local communities, and more effectively target poor and vulnerable groups. The purpose of this study is to assess the impacts of Fadama II, which is a CDD project and the largest agricultural project in Nigeria. This study used propensity score matching (PSM) to select 1728 comparable project beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. The study also used double difference methods to compare the impact indicators. Our results show that Fadama II project succeeded in targeting the poor and women farmers in its productive asset acquisition component. Participation in the project also increased the income of beneficiaries by about 60 percent, which is well above the targeted increase of only 20 percent in the six year period of the project. Regarding rural infrastructure investments, we found that the Fadama II project had positive near-term impacts on beneficiaries� access to markets and transportation costs, although the study revealed surprising effects on beneficiaries� commercial behavior and statistically insignificant impacts on nonfarm activities. We also observed that Fadama II increased the demand for postharvest handling technologies but did not have a significant impact on the demand for financial management and market information. Fadama II reduced the demand for soil fertility management technologies. The decline likely reflects the project�s focus on providing postproduction advisory services and suggests the need for the project to increase its support for soil fertility management and thus limit the potential for land degradation resulting from increased agricultural productivity. Overall, the Fadama II project has achieved its goal of increasing the incomes of the beneficiaries in the first year of its operation. The project has also succeeded in targeting the poor and vulnerable in its productive-asset component, even though that did not appear to increase significantly short-term household incomes among the poorest asset tercile. The unique feature that could have contributed to the significant impact of the project in a short time is its broad-based approach, which addresses the major constraints limiting the success of CDD projects that address only one or two constraints. This has implications on planning poverty reduction efforts in low-income countries. Given that the poor face numerous constraints, a CDD project that simultaneously addresses many constraints will likely build synergies that will lead to larger impacts than will a project that addresses only one or two constraints. This suggests the need for the government and donors to pool resources and initiate multipronged CDD projects rather than many isolated projects.--Author's Abstract",Open Access,,"Nkonya, Ephraim

They are an indispensable tool when it comes to assessing the contribution of agricultural S&T to agricultural growth and, more generally, economic growth. S&T indicators assist research managers and policymakers in policy formulation and decision-making on strategic planning, priority setting, monitoring, and evaluation. They also provide information to government and other institutions (e.g., policy research institutes, universities, and the private sector) involved in the public debate on the state of agricultural S&T at national, regional, and international levels. This brief reviews the major investment, capacity, and institutional trends in public agricultural research in Mexico since 1981, using recent data collected under the Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) initiative (IFPRIINIFAP 2007-08) and underlying data sets of an unpublished report by Beintema et al.

At the same time, rising food prices provide an incentive and opportunity for many developing countries to strengthen the contribution their farmers make to national economic growth and poverty reduction. Policymakers and opinion leaders in developing countries, however, often lack sufficient information to gauge the likely effects of global food crises on their country and to identify, design, and implement policy actions that can best avoid risks and take advantage of opportunities. The deficiencies in information and analysis can lead to overand underreactions, resulting in policy and market failures. Experiences across countries in 2007 and 2008 show ample evidence of such outcomes. Although the food crisis information currently available is alarming and sufficient to initiate largescale action, the information base must be improved to make that action more effective.--From Text",Open Access,,"Benson, Todd

If the government's poverty reduction goals are to be achieved, Nigeria will need an adequate level of strategically targeted investments in agriculture to upgrade rural infrastructure, boost productivity, and increase competitiveness. Before effective investment programs can be designed and implemented, however, it is important to have a clear understanding of the current pattern of public spending on agriculture. The Nigeria Agriculture Public Expenditure Review (NAGPER), a collaborative study carried out by a research team from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the World Bank, assesses the quantity and quality of public spending in agriculture and evaluates its degree of alignment with government policy goals.

832,"""Governments in Asia used grain price stabilization as a major policy instrument when they began to promote the Green Revolution in the 1960s. In the process, they created parastatal agencies, which were quasi-governmental in nature, to undertake public marketing activities in basic staples such as rice and wheat. These operations often meant providing a support price to farmers, procuring staples on government account, holding public stocks, and distributing these stocks through public distribution systems or open market operations to hold the price line for consumers. This led to a sizeable degree of government intervention in most of these countries' grain markets, which continues to a large extent today."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Rashid, Shahidur

Some studies found a positive correlation of HIV infection with socioeconomic status, but others found negative or insignificant relationship. Most existing studies did not explicitly pay attention to the fact that each study came from different countries (areas) at different stages of the epidemic. Because of data constraint, most studies examined �snapshots� of factors associated with HIV infection in a specific country during a specific time frame (e.g., Malawi 2000) using cross-sectional data. Very few studies focus on how infection factors change with the depth of the AIDS epidemic.

This growth recovery has made a dent in poverty and holds out hope that a number of African countries may reach the Millennium Development Goal targets for poverty and food security (MDG 1), if not by 2015, then within the following few years. Agricultural growth has been, and will remain, key to reducing poverty and hunger in Africa. To significantly reduce poverty, Africa needs to sustain, broaden, and accelerate its recent growth performance and boost its investments in agriculture. The recent spike in global food prices represents an opportunity that could support further agricultural sector growth in Africa.

More than 15 years of rigorous research on gender and intrahousehold resource allocation suggest not only that men and women will be affected differently by the global food crisis, but also that, as both consumers and producers, they will have different stocks of resources with which to respond to rising prices. Although the current situation calls for an urgent national and international response, urgency is not an excuse for misguided policies that fail to address the gender implications of the crisis. Instead, decisionmakers should take this opportunity to incorporate what is known about women's roles in agricultural production and household welfare, and the specific challenges they face, both to craft more effective policy responses and to enable women to respond better to the current challenges and opportunities."" -- from Author's text",Open Access,,"Quisumbing, Agnes R.

The challenge of meeting MDG1 under the current circumstances is considerable, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Of the means used to promote agricultural growth, sound government spending can be one of the most direct and effective. This brief presents ranges of estimates of the costs involved using two different approaches. There have been numerous attempts to estimate the costs of achieving MDG1, mostly at the global or regional level, including the United Nations' Zedillo Report and studies by the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme. These estimates have varied widely, mostly because of different methodologies, assumptions, coverage, measures, and interpretations. The two primary methodologies used in these studies have involved unit costs and growth-poverty elasticities (determining the extent to which poverty declines as growth increases). There has been no consistent basis of analysis for the first method, and studies using the second have been limited by data availability. We have attempted to address some of these issues by providing improved, research-based estimates of the global and regional investments required to achieve MDG1. Because this is a complex issue and each of the approaches mentioned above has distinct merits, we have decided to produce estimates based on both approaches to provide a fuller picture. Expanding on the two approaches, we also present estimates of the costs of financing the inputs required for accelerating agricultural production in SSA."" -- from Author's text",Open Access,,"Fan, Shenggen

840,"""During the past several decades, developing countries have had mixed results in reducing poverty. While East Asia (particularly China) has achieved astonishing progress in eradicating severe poverty through strong agricultural and overall economic growth, many African countries have experienced an increase in the number of poor. Today, more than 1 billion people still live on less than US$1 per day, and the recent surge in food prices has caused another 100 million people in developing countries to fall into poverty. It is obvious, therefore, that a ""business as usual"" approach is wholly inadequate. In recognition of the fact that persistent poverty and malnutrition result in irreversible costs to human and economic development, developing countries and the international development community have been intensifying their efforts to increase and redirect resources in order to achieve specific development objectives such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, public resources are limited, so prioritization is clearly critical. Policymakers want to know what public spending programs have the largest impact on the poor and how the resources should be allocated among different sectors, such as agriculture, infrastructure, health, and education. In recent years, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has conducted numerous studies related to public spending and its impact on growth and poverty reduction. The findings from those studies have been brought together in a new book, Public Expenditures, Growth, and Poverty: Lessons from Developing Countries (published for IFPRI by the Johns Hopkins University Press and, in South Asia, by Oxford University Press). The approach used in the book differs from previous work in that it considers multiple types of government spending, including investments in agriculture, infrastructure, health, education, and social safety nets; recognizes that investments have a direct impact on poverty reduction through multiple channels; and links the effects of public investment to its overall social benefits and cost, using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Fan, Shenggen",,126331.pdf,126170,,,,,,2012-01-06,2018-05-31,,,,,IFPRI1,DSGD,,http://www.ifpri.org/publication/public-expenditures-growth-and-poverty-developing-countries,,,IB51,English,,852422126,"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2658-4863 Fan, Shenggen",Non-PR,4 pages,"Washington, D.C.",,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,Brief,Full Book: http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/126222,mailto:ifpri-library@cgiar.org,,Issue Brief,51,,poverty alleviation,"AFRICA

The main goal of the project was to contribute to poverty-reduction efforts by identifying effective policies and practices that enhance the ways that collective action and property rights are used to build secure assets and income streams for and by the poor. The project intended to provide policymakers, NGOs, and community groups with knowledge of the factors that strengthen the rights of the poor to land and water resources and lead to more effective collective action by the poor. Four CGIAR centers and two German universities conducted empirical research on the role of collective action and property rights for disadvantaged groups. The briefs in this set represent the case studies that were part of the project. The case studies rely on a variety of research methods, including qualitative and quantitative approaches, participatory action research, and experimental games. They also cover a variety of contexts within Africa and Asia, which will allow policymakers, researchers, and practitioners to further examine what constitutes poverty and affects the welfare of the poor between and within countries, and to draw comparisons."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Mwangi, Esther, ed.

The world is making only slow progress in reducing food insecurity, according to the Global Hunger Index (GHI). Some regions—in particular South and Southeast Asia, the Near East and North Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean—have made significant headway in combating hunger and malnutrition since 1990, but in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the GHI remains high. Moreover, progress in Sub-Saharan Africa since 1990 has been marginal. The GHI is a tool developed by IFPRI for regularly tracking the state of global hunger and malnutrition. This year’s index reflects data until 2006—the most recent available global data—and does not yet take account of the latest changes in the world food system, in which a number of factors are converging to raise prices for agricultural commodities to their highest levels in decades. Food prices appear likely to remain high in the near term, leading to food and nutrition insecurity for poor people around the globe. In this risky and changing environment, the GHI highlights key trends and the geographic areas of greatest vulnerability."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"von Grebmer, Klaus

846,"In many developing countries, information regarding the occurrence of a disease outbreak must travel through a network of individuals and institutions before it reaches the central government. Likewise, the response must travel back through these networks. Any break in these networks could delay the flow of information and action in either direction, potentially delaying the response and raising the risk of a wider outbreak. It is therefore important to identify the flow of information for disease reporting among institutions, and also to identify how influential these institutions are in terms of their impact on information flow and response to disease occurrence. Thus, researchers from IFPRI and ILRI conducted network mapping exercises with participating stakeholders from governmental agencies, the private sector, research institutions, and farmer and trader organizations during the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) inception workshops held separately in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria to answer the following questions: How does information about a suspected outbreak of avian influenza on the farm or market level reach the respective authorities? How and through which actors is the response to a confirmed outbreak implemented on the ground? In all of these countries, network maps (or Net-Maps) were prepared indicating the actors involved, their different kinds of linkages, and the influence that these actors have on making sure that the information about suspected outbreaks on the farm or market level reaches the national authorities and that an appropriate and timely response is implemented. The Net-Maps were based on experience with past interventions from the participants as well as their expert opinions. The Net-Maps also helped identify bottlenecks in communication and response that need further attention. This brief draws out the main findings from the Net-Maps of the study countries, including the potential breakpoints in the disease reporting and response networks.",Open Access,,"Schiffer, Eva

847,"The recent food crisis, combined with the energy crisis and emerging climate change issues, threatens the livelihoods of millions of poor people as well as the economic, ecological, and political situation in many developing countries. On top of these crises, the decades of shrinking global investment in agricultural research are leading to slower growth in agricultural productivity. Progress in achieving development goals-such as cutting hunger and poverty in half by 2015-has been delayed significantly. In fact, the number of hungry people actually increased by at least 75 million from 2004 to 2007 and probably by even more in 2008. Investment potential in developing-country agriculture is improving, but realizing this potential requires policy action. Addressing these challenges will require the world to develop a more productive and sustainable food and agricultural system. More and more experts and policymakers agree that investment in agriculture and in related, research-based innovations must be accelerated. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is particularly well positioned to contribute to the global effort to foster sustainable food production, increase access to food, and reduce poverty and hunger in rural and urban areas. Its 15 international research centers generate publicly available research on everything from dryland and tropical agriculture, to livestock, to agroforestry, to water management and fisheries. They have decades of experience in agricultural research and participate in a worldwide network of partnerships. The CGIAR is now redesigning its structure and organization to address these global challenges, but it also requires increased funding.",Open Access,,"von Braun, Joachim

A new focus on the vulnerability of families, and threats to the human capital of children with lifelong and intergenerational consequences, has accelerated international, regional, and national commitments to social protection programs in heavily AIDS-affected countries. Social protection in the form of cash transfers—which can provide support for food purchases, transportation, education, health care and other expenses—is receiving increasing recognition as an important part of a comprehensive AIDS response. The urgency of cash assistance for food purchases is underscored by emerging evidence on the effect of good nutrition to slowing the progression of AIDS, and to the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy, with consequences not only for people living with HIV but also their children, broader families and communities.",Open Access,,"Adato, Michelle

850,"""In times of economic turmoil, countries might decide to increase current tariff rates to protect domestic industries or raise revenues in order to finance domestic programs. Using the highest applied or bound rate imposed by countries from 1995 to 2008 as an indicator, this study presents several scenarios regarding the economic costs of a failed Doha Round and a subsequent rush into protectionism. For example, in a scenario where the applied tariffs of major economies would go all the way up to currently bound tariff rates, world trade would decrease by 7.7 percent. In a more modest scenario where countries would raise tariffs to maximum rates applied during the past 13 years, world trade would decrease by 3.2 percent. These increases in duties would reduce world welfare by US$353 billion under the first scenario, and by US$134 billion under the more modest scenario. While such an increase in duties would particularly impact agricultural exports (–6.9 percent), especially in developing countries (–11.5 percent), exports of industrial goods could also face a substantial reduction: 2 percent in developed countries and 4.8 percent in developing countries. This study concludes there would be a potential loss of US$1,064 billion in world trade if world leaders were to fail to conclude the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations in the next few weeks and if countries were to implement subsequently protectionist policies, as occurred after the end of the Uruguay Round. The failure of the negotiations would prevent a US$336 billion increase in world trade that would have come from a reduction in tariffs and domestic support, while a worldwide resort to protectionism would contract world trade by US$728 billion."" -- from text",Open Access,,"Bouët, Antoine

Although the maize plant is quite hardy and adaptable to harsh conditions, warmer temperatures and lower levels of precipitation could have detrimental effects on yields, thereby increasing food insecurity in the region.

852,"Ethiopia possesses abundant water resources and hydropower potential, yet less than 5 percent of irrigable land in the Blue Nile basin has been developed for food production, and more than 80 percent of Ethiopians lack access to electricity. Consequently, the Ethiopian government is pursuing plans to develop hydropower and irrigation along the Blue Nile River in an effort to tap into this underused potential. Although approximately 84 percent of the inflow to Lake Nasser at Aswan, Egypt, initiates from Ethiopia through the Blue Nile and Atbara Rivers, Ethiopia has limited rights to use these resources. Egypt and Sudan, through the Agreement of 1959, are allotted 55.5 and 18.5 billion cubic meters each year, respectively, with no allotment to Ethiopia. In 1998 the Nile Basin Initiative was created to stimulate cooperation among all countries in the Nile basin and work toward amicable alternatives and solutions for water resources benefits. This brief is based on a paper that analyzes potential hydropower generation and irrigation supply for four large-scale dams and reservoirs along the Blue Nile River within Ethiopia—Karadobi, Mabil, Mendaia, and Border—as proposed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation in 1964. The total installed hydropower capacity would be 5,570 megawatts of power, about 2.5 times the potential of the Aswan High Dam in Egypt. Irrigation associated with the Mendaia and Border reservoirs could expand by 250,000 hectares or 35 percent of the estimated total irrigable land in the Blue Nile basin. The challenges of implementation, however, are not inconsequential. The proposed reservoirs not only raise financing, investment, political, and institutional challenges, but may also require many years to fill, which will affect downstream flows depending on variable climate and climate change conditions. Using a model for hydropower and irrigation analysis, the paper explores dam implementation viability under various policy options."" -- from text",Open Access,,"Block, Paul J.

853,"While early studies tended to find positive correlations between economic resources, education and HIV infection, as the epidemic has progressed, it has increasingly been assumed that this relationship is changing. But what is really known about the degree, type and dynamics of the influence of socioeconomic factors on rates of HIV transmission in different settings and at various stages of the AIDS epidemic? This brief highlights the key findings of a review of studies that sought to address this question. In most countries, relatively rich and better educated men and women have higher rates of partner change because they have greater personal autonomy and spatial mobility. Although the richer and better educated are likely to have better access to reproductive health care, condom use is generally low in Africa and other parts of the developing world. Pre-existing sexual behaviour patterns therefore make the richer and the better educated more vulnerable to HIV infection, especially in the early stages of the epidemic, when information about the virus and how to protect oneself is usually low. At a later stage, however, it has been argued that individuals with higher socioeconomic status tend to adopt safer sexual practices, once the effects of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality become more apparent, adding greater credibility to HIV prevention messages.",Open Access,,"Gillespie, Stuart

As a result, most increases in aggregate crop production have been achieved from the expansion of cultivated land rather than increased investment in production technologies to raise crop yields per unit area of land. As access to land is increasingly constrained by high population growth, further expansion of cultivated land will be unsustainable. How can Ugandan farmers make more productive use of the land they now have? Research has shown that secure land tenure is an important institutional factor affecting agricultural technology utilization by smallholder farmers by providing incentives for greater investment to enhance the productivity of the land.

Recognizing the importance of staple food markets both for general economic growth and broad poverty reduction and given the centrality of access to staple food for household welfare, the government of Uganda has targeted value addition for staple food crops as a priority area for agricultural development.

Inorganic fertilizer can be a powerful productivity enhancing input. While Uganda has one of the highest soil nutrient depletion rates in the world, it has one of the lowest rates of annual inorganic fertilizer application – only 1.8 kg per hectare. The World Bank calculated that the value of replacing these depleted soil nutrients could be 20 percent of average rural Ugandan household income.

Between 2000 and 2006, the value of exports climbed from US $401 million to US $962 million, with agricultural products accounting for 60 percent of this. The growth in agricultural exports is largely attributed to a series of institutional reforms designed to modernize the economy and increase productivity. The result of these reforms has been increased private investment and a reduced role for direct government interventions in the agricultural export sector. However, some gaps remain that reduce the efficiency of the markets. Ugandan farmers continue to have limited access to markets in developed economies. Moreover, the evolving structure of export value chains globally has resulted in Ugandan smallholders, in particular, facing increased competition from high quality producers elsewhere. Value chain analysis offers insight into the operations of specific marketing channels by assessing the growth potential for particular export commodities.

In this context, the influence of cash savings or income generated through use or sale of natural resources (e.g., using fuelwood instead of electricity to be able to afford to buy food) is also not known. Indeed, to date the environmental dimensions of the AIDS epidemic remain little explored, despite the centrality of the natural environment in the livelihoods of the rural poor across Africa. Filling this information gap is important, given that Sub-Saharan Africa is generally typified by the interlinked phenomena of rapidly rising HIV prevalence rates, high levels of food insecurity, dependence on natural resources for rural livelihoods, climatic variability, and environmental degradation.

Excess mortality is concentrated among women between the ages of 25 and 39 and among men between the ages of 30 and 44. Households can respond to an increase in mortality among prime-age adults in many ways—they can utilize government grants and formal insurance; engage in some ex ante and ex post risk coping/mitigating strategies (e.g., borrowing or tapping on remittances) to buffer shocks; and/or develop foster-care arrangements or income diversification strategies (including labor supply). There are, however, problems with these approaches. If such strategies are imperfect in smoothing consumption, prime-age adult death can decrease child schooling investments and increase labor supply, at least in the short-run. Moreover, prime-age adult death also reduces the expected future earnings for the household. This, in turn, reduces investments in child schooling, given that the period over which capital is formed is long and the loan market is imperfect. Typically, the growth in the number of orphans in a society is taxing on both families and the society and an increase in mortality among prime-age adults, unlike mortality in other age groups, directly reduces the capability of households to secure income.",Open Access,,"Yamauchi, Futoshi

It constitutes more than half of the country's gross domestic product, generates more than 85 percent of foreign exchange earnings, and employs about 80 percent of the population. Unfortunately, Ethiopia's dependence on agriculture makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change on crop and livestock production. Thus, a deeper understanding of the complex interdependence between changing climatic conditions and Ethiopia's agricultural sector- together with adaptation options-is crucial. Additional information about farmers' awareness of climate change and current adaptation approaches would assist policymakers in their efforts to decrease the country's vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change. This brief is based on a study that endeavors to guide policymakers on ways to promote greater adaptation by identifying the household characteristics that increase farmers' awareness of climate change and influence farmers' decision to adapt.",Open Access,,"Deressa, Temesgen T.

866,"""A “supermarket revolution” has been underway in developing countries since the early 1990s. Supermarkets (here referring to all modern retail, which includes chain stores of various formats such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, and convenience and neighborhood stores) have now gone well beyond the initial upper- and middle-class clientele in many countries to reach the mass market. Within the food system, the effects of this trend touch not only traditional retailers, but also the wholesale, processing, and farm sectors. The supermarket revolution is a “two-edged sword.” On the one hand, it can lower food prices for consumers and create opportunities for farmers and processors to gain access to quality-differentiated food markets and raise incomes. On the other hand, it can create challenges for small retailers, farmers, and processors who are not equipped to meet the new competition and requirements from supermarkets. Developing-country governments can put in place a number of policies to help both traditional retailers and small farmers pursue “competitiveness with inclusiveness” in the era of the supermarket revolution.

867,"Agriculture is the mainstay for Uganda's economy, providing both food and foreign exchange. Liberalization of the economy and expansion of the area under cultivation led to a steady growth of the agricultural sector in the 1990s of over 4 percent per year. However, Uganda's population remains largely poor. Food crop production accounts for 65 percent of the GDP, yet agriculture continues to be characterized by low productivity. Moreover, land is increasingly becoming scarce, and a population growth rate of 3.5 percent per year prevents sustainable expansion. In view of these constraints, the National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAADS) has emphasized the importance of rural enterprise promotion to develop a market-oriented agricultural sector in Uganda. NAADS supports farmers in developing profitable enterprises and meeting demands both for quality and quantity of produce to exploit agricultural market opportunities. Most Ugandan farmers are smallholders lacking capital for investment and other resources, limiting the range of economic activities in which they might engage. Consequently, how they select enterprises to invest in is critical.

This is largely because poverty levels are high, and developing-country capacity to adapt to global change is weak. Furthermore, the rural populations of developing countries—for whom agricultural production is the primary source of direct and indirect employment and income—will be most affected due agriculture’s vulnerability to global change processes. The agricultural sector is the largest consumer of water resources, and variability in water supply has a major influence on health and welfare in poor areas. With water scarcity and extreme weather events expected to increase under climate change, water security could decline significantly in rural areas. Consequently, it is important to understand the impacts of global change (in terms of climate, demography, technology, and so on) on agriculture and natural resources in developing countries and to develop adaptive capacity to respond to these impacts. Moreover, there is a need to develop informed and effective adaptation measures and investment options that can be taken now to alleviate adverse impacts of global change in the future.",Open Access,,"Ringler, Claudia",,13806.cpd,13805,,,,,,2015-10-20,2015-10-20,,,,,"IFPRI1

871,"With likely long-term changes in rainfall patterns and shifting temperature zones, climate change is expected to increase the frequency of climate-related shocks, such as floods and droughts in Sub-Saharan Africa. For farm households, an increase in the frequency of climate-related income shocks could lead not only to lower expected income, but also to higher income variance, which in turn can cause them to pursue costly risk-coping strategies and to fall below poverty trap thresholds. For this reason, it is important to understand how a changing distribution of risk will lead to increased vulnerability, not just decreased expected income. This brief is based on a paper that uses farm households' responses to climate-related shocks in South Africa's Limpopo River Basin to gauge how farmers are likely to respond to future climate change shocks. The increased frequency and severity of droughts associated with global warming may induce farmers to change their behavior to reduce their risk of negative impacts from future climaterelated shocks. While it is difficult to predict farmers' behavior and how it will affect welfare, coping strategies used in response to shocks today can be used to predict whether and how rural South Africans will cope in the future. The study examines household responses to droughts in 2005 and household vulnerability to future climate change by assessing their probability of falling below an income threshold as a result of future climate-related shocks. Assessing household vulnerability is important because efficient social policy needs to go beyond poverty alleviation in the present to prevent poverty in the future. A poverty reduction strategy that doesnot distinguish between transient and structural poverty leads to inefficient use of resources, in that it focuses on those who are temporarily poor but may be able to escape poverty on their own, at the expense of those who have a high probability of becoming chronically poor.",Open Access,,"Shewmake, Sharon",,13818.cpd,13817,,,,,,2015-02-27,2015-02-27,,,,,"IFPRI2

872,"""1. The facts: Child malnutrition in India India is home to 40 percent of the world’s malnourished children and 35 percent of the developing world’s low-birth-weight infants; every year 2.5 million children die in India, accounting for one in five deaths in the world. More than half of these deaths could be prevented if children were well nourished.  India’s progress in reducing child malnutrition has been slow. The prevalence of child malnutrition in India deviates further from the expected level at the country’s per capita income than in any other large developing country.; 2. The challenge: Accelerating progress in reducing child malnutrition in India India has many nutrition and social safety net programs, some of which (such as Integrated Child Development Services [ICDS] and the Public Distribution System [PDS]) have had success in several states in addressing the needs of poor households. All of these programs have potential, but they do not form a comprehensive nutrition strategy, and they have not addressed the nutrition problem effectively so far.; 3. Strategic choices for improved child nutrition India lacks a comprehensive nutrition strategy. Various choices for nutrition strategies can be considered. A review of some of the more successful country experiences suggests that all of them implemented complex, multisectoral actions with more or less emphasis on service-oriented nutrition policies (as in Indonesia), incentive-oriented nutrition policies linked to community or household participation and performance (as in Mexico), or mobilization-oriented nutrition policies (as in Thailand). These choices are not mutually exclusive. India now has the opportunity to “leapfrog” toward innovative nutritional improvement based on the experiences of other countries and on experiences within India itself.; 4. Cooperation for policy actions To accelerate progress in reducing child malnutrition, India should focus on the following four cross-cutting strategic approaches: a. ensuring that economic growth and poverty reduction policies reach the poor;; b. redesigning nutrition and health policies and programs by drawing on science and technology for nutritional improvement, strengthening their implementation, and increasing their coverage;; c. increasing investments and actions in nutrition services for  communities with the highest concentration of poor; and; d. focusing programs on girls’ and women’s health and nutrition. IFPRI, in collaboration with Indian experts and international networks, could bring much-needed experience with programs and policies around the world to bear on this effort. An evidence-based, research-intensive approach with “learning while implementing”—which has shown success in other countries—is recommended. There is no time or reason to wait for taking action."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"von Braun, Joachim

873,"""This report presents an overview of the Philippine national agricultural R&D system in the context of the country’s wider national science and technology (S&T) policy. The discussion includes institutional developments and recent trends in human and financial resources based on data collected under the Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI) initiative. With a total of close to 4,000 full-time equivalent researchers in 2002, the Philippines has one of the largest agricultural research systems in Asia. But in terms of total agricultural research spending, the Philippines ranks behind more economically advanced Asian countries such as Malaysia and South Korea. Nonetheless, agricultural R&D spending in the Philippines has shown significant growth in recent years. In 2002, the country invested $269 million in agricultural R&D (in 2000 international dollars), which is an increase of two-thirds over the level recorded a decade earlier. Public agricultural R&D in the Philippines is heavily reliant on government sources of support. In 2002, the Philippine government provided more than 85 percent of funding to the government agencies. In recent years, however, the share of internally generated resources has gradually increased. Foreign donor support plays only a marginal role in the Philippine agricultural R&D system, distinguishing it from some other countries in the region. The organization of public agricultural R&D in the Philippines is complex. The Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (PCARRD) acts as the central coordinating body providing support to 132 implementing R&D agencies collectively called the National Agriculture and Resources Research and Development Network (NARRDN) as well as 14 region-based consortia. Compared to most countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the private sector plays a relatively important role in conducting agricultural R&D in the Philippines. We estimated that about 18 percent of total (public and private) spending in agricultural R&D was done by the private sector, mostly fruit plantations."" -- Authors' Preface",Open Access,,"Stads, Gert-Jan

874,"Many governments in developing countries attempt to foster agricultural development and innovation by setting up funding facilities, extension programs, and research centers and by subsidizing private-sector and farm activities through fiscal measures. However, when trying to manage complex innovation processes involving many and different actors, governments sometimes find it difficult to design effective interventions and therefore end up supporting and managing only the public research and extension organizations that directly depend upon them. With the aid of various donors, Bolivia introduced a scheme in 2001—the Bolivian Agricultural Technology System (SIBTA)—by which government support to agricultural research and extension was partly delegated to regional semiautonomous foundations. This brief presents the results of a study on the role of the Bolivian government in guiding and managing SIBTA. The study found that despite a number of weaknesses related to the design of the system and the government's limited commitment, the regional foundations have been able to effectively identify the demands of small farmers, set priorities, and provide transparency and accountability with regard to funding and decisionmaking. It suggests that instead of micromanaging such foundations, the government should focus on the big picture and conduct policy analysis and strategic planning to identify opportunities for agricultural innovation and set up incentive mechanisms and information networks that support the many actors involved in innovation processes."" -- from text",Open Access,,"Hartwich, Frank

894,"""The current global agreement governing food aid—the Food Aid Convention (FAC)—will expire in 2007.  It has come under heavy criticism as has the diffuse set of broader food aid governance institutions that has emerged in the last 50 years.  These institutions are characterized by overlapping mandates, differing degrees of authority and legitimacy, varied levels of transparency in decisionmaking, and problematic representation of the major stakeholders.  A number of issues are likely to arise during the course of negotiations over a new FAC.  These include its objectives; the nature of commitments—whether to express them in tonnage, value, or nutritional terms; the level of commitments and their distribution among donor countries; monitoring and enforcement of commitments; representation on the FAC governing body among food aid donor- and recipient-country governments and civil society organizations; and the institutional “home” of the FAC. More specifically, there is debate over such questions as whether the new FAC should have an “instrument focus”—food aid—or a “problem focus” such as “food security” or “hunger.”  If the focus is on addressing hunger, should food aid under the FAC be restricted to emergencies only or should it pertain to broader food security issues?  Should the FAC be a low-key forum for exchange of information or should it have some meaningful ways of monitoring commitments and encouraging compliance by both donors and recipients?  Debates such as these will reflect views on the purposes of food aid itself.  Conversely, debates regarding these broader questions carry consequences for the formation of views on the issues involved in the FAC negotiations. This paper’s purpose is solely to outline issues and options; hence it does not advocate for particular positions."" -- Authors' Abstract",Open Access,,"Hoddinott, John F.

Furthermore, growth patterns have not been uniform across commodities or geographic regions. To increase agricultural performance, it is essential to target the small farmers who constitute the largest segment of producers. Policy objectives should aim to improve the delivery of services to smallholders and to develop new ways to include smallholders in more efficient value chains.",Open Access,,"Chamberlin, Jordan

Despite its impressive progress in economic growth and poverty reduction, Ghana—like many other African countries—has had rather limited success in increasing smallholder agricultural production by enhancing productivity and competitiveness. Why? Like other countries, Ghana has to meet three challenges in selecting and implementing policies and programs for inclusive agricultural growth: the political feasibility challenge, the administrative feasibility challenge, and the fiscal feasibility challenge.

Food security and pri-mary agricultural commodities have been largely left out of these discussions; the authors begin to fill these gaps...  the paper recommends four agendas for further food policy consideration: first, more attention to equitable outcomes in food distribution and food production and trade programs, so that such food security programs do not further contribute to ethnic divisions favoring violence-prone grievance and greed. Second, more careful scrutiny of national marketing and financial policies that influence farmer and middlemen income, and who benefits from agricultural export crops. Third, the design of some type of compensation fund for sudden or certain “losers” in globalization, who face loss of livelihood and recruitment to violence when cash crops like coffee fail to deliver expected livelihoods.

The divergent and sometimes contradictory positions are grounded in deep-seated beliefs about technology, the environment, the global order, and the meaning of development among the various stakeholders. This paper seeks to explain the arguments that underlie the different positions taken by national and regional stakeholders, including representatives of public bodies, the private sector, and civil society, on the role of biotechnology. It describes efforts to develop a common process for discussion of the issues. The aim of the dialogue is to agree on the process, rather than to develop consensus.",Open Access,,"von Grebmer, Klaus

911,"Agriculture is fundamental to achieving nutrition goals: it produces the food, energy, and nutrients essential for human health and well-being. Gains in food production have played a key role in feeding growing and malnourished populations. Yet they have not translated into a hunger-free world nor prevented the development of further nutritional challenges. Micronutrient deficiencies (for example, of vitamin A, iron, iodine, and zinc) are now recognized as being even more limiting for human growth, development, health, and productivity than energy deficits. Hunger among the poor also increasingly manifests itself through excessive consumption of energy-rich but nutrient-poor foods. The result is a double burden of undernutrition (deficiencies of energy, micronutrients, or both) and “overnutrition” (poor diet quality leading to obesity and other diet-related chronic illnesses).",Open Access,,"Hawkes, Corinna

913,"Malaria, schistosomiasis (bilharzia), and Japanese encephalitis are the major vector-borne diseases whose increase or decrease can be attributed to agricultural water development (see table). Others include dengue fever, yellow fever, and filariasis. Young children in poor communities are particularly affected: malaria is among the top five causes of death among under-fives in Sub-Saharan Africa; schistosomiasis among children affects growth, nutritional status, and cognitive development; and encephalitis occurs mainly in young children... Water development projects bring important benefits locally and globally. Yet it is often assumed that irrigation will bring health benefits to all, regardless of their socioeconomic standing within a community. In reality, the economic and social impacts of irrigation are diverse and widespread, and neither costs nor benefits are evenly distributed among community members. In Sub-Saharan Africa, as elsewhere in the world, there is increasing recognition of the need to reduce the negative impacts of agricultural development on ecosystems and peoples’ health. Unless well-targeted interventions are made, the most vulnerable—notably poor children and their mothers—will continue to benefit least from the promise of irrigation and suffer most from the adverse health impacts."" -- From text",Open Access,,"Mutero, Clifford M.

Because of the “public good” nature of agricultural research for developing countries, it was assumed that the private sector would not invest sufficiently in producing knowledge and technologies that contribute to rural development and poverty alleviation there. So public agencies and aid organizations have initiated and subsidized agricultural research and innovation to supplement the knowledge and technology produced by private entities. Yet many of these publicly generated improvements have not been useful to farmers, processors, and agribusiness and hence have not been adopted on a wide scale. Others have not been transferred to those who would have contentedly absorbed them. At the same time, the production and marketing technologies for the fastest-growing products, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, have been introduced mostly by the private sector. In this context, it is crucial to revisit the role the private sector can play in generating knowledge and technology for agricultural development. What functions do farm input providers, farmers, processors, traders, and exporters have in agricultural innovation processes, and how can they become more directly involved in the financing, generation, diffusion, and adoption of new knowledge and technologies?"" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Pomareda, Carlos

With this in mind, IFPRI’s Global Hunger Index (GHI) was designed to help mobilize political will and promote good policies by ranking countries and illustrating trends. It captures three dimensions of hunger: insufficient availability of food, shortfalls in the nutritional status of children, and child mortality, which is to a large extent attributable to undernutrition. Accordingly, the index includes the following three equally weighted indicators: the proportion of people who are food energy deficient as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the prevalence of underweight in children under the age of five as compiled by the World Health Organization, and the under-five mortality rate as reported by UNICEF"" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Wiesmann, Doris",,38626.cpd,38625,,,,,,2017-11-29,2017-11-29,,,,,IFPRI1,FCND,,http://www.ifpri.org/pubs/ib/ib47.asp,,,IB47,English,,778454626,,Non-PR,6 pages,"Washington, D.C.",,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,Brief,,mailto:ifpri-library@cgiar.org,,Issue Brief,47,,,WORLD,"Hunger

For the technology to materialize, growers must perceive the yield advantages of the inserted traits. Field surveys confirm that farmers can readily discern stemborers and the losses they cause to maize crops (De Groote et al. 2004). In contrast, farmers have greater difficulty observing hidden biotic agents, such as nematode infestation of banana roots. This is further complicated by farmers incorrectly identifying the cause and effect of the pest or disease; for example, farmers often attribute the visible damages caused by Fusarium wilt, a soil-borne fungus, as well as nematodes, to weevils, and vice versa (Gold et al. 1993).

Maize continues to be the major food staple, and Kenyans have one of the highest rates of maize consumption per capita in Africa. Kenya experienced spectacular maize breeding successes in the 1960s and 1970s, with diffusion curves for hybrids as steep as those of the U.S. Corn Belt in preceding decades (Gerhart 1975). In the past few decades, however, a number of factors have contributed to stagnating national maize production, including a secular (long-term) decline in soil fertility and decreasing public research investments.",Open Access,,"Smale, Melinda

931,"""With half the world’s population living in cities and towns, many poor urban dwellers face problems gaining access to adequate supplies of nutritionally balanced food. For many urban populations, an important source of food is urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA). Production and processing of crops—particularly horticultural crops—and livestock is frequently part of urban and peri-urban livelihood strategies, and the food produced forms a large part of informal sector economic activity. This brief examines the benefits and problems of UPA for the nutrition and health of poor urban and peri-urban populations... An adequate health-impact assessment of urban agriculture is still incomplete.Research questions remain concerning the level of chronic disease risk posed by contamination of urban food from air pollution, as well from industrial effluents. Further assessment is needed of the health risks of using biological wastes as fertilizer. Research questions also remain regarding the infectious disease risks posed by urban livestock keeping... Adequate waste treatment systems and sanitation need to be provided to poor countries’ urban areas, but the technologies should be designed to capture the nutrients in waste for increased food production. Control of discharges into soil, air, and water by industries, whether large factories or small kiosks, is likewise essential. Existing environmental legislation needs to be made effective by proper implementation through both community action and government support in urban neighborhoods."" -- From text",Open Access,,"Lee-Smith, Diana

Devolving authority to the lowest levels possible can improve the effectiveness of the management of common pool resources, if the state is willing and able to back the rules established at those levels. (2.) State recognition of common property systems is essential to enable those who depend on the commons to reap the benefits from these areas. (3.) Strengthening individual property rights can undermine the existence of the commons. (4.) Devising strategies and mechanisms to strengthen group institutions, and making sure they are accountable and transparent for all members, can increase overall security of the commons. (5.) Fostering innovative ways to diversify the livelihoods of commons users can help reach both equity and environmental stewardship objectives. (6.)

The formal introduction of new hybrid bananas into the region began in 1997 with the efforts of the Kagera Community Development Program (KCDP). The goal of the program was to increase farmers’ food and income security by improving banana productivity.

Traditionally, agricultural and health policies address specific goals within those sectors. Agricultural policies address conservation of the natural resource base, protection of farmers’ livelihoods, basic needs of the poor including food security, and the context for regulations on, among other things, food safety and the sound use of  pesticides. National public health policies are also sectorally driven and reflect the dichotomy in the health sector between preventive action and curative care... [A] conducive policy framework is essential for effective agriculture-health collaboration. This framework should be comprehensive, focus on strategic issues, be periodically reviewed and updated, and maintain criteria that recognize the bidirectional nature of the links.

Yet the divisions between the two sectors are wide and difficult to bridge. Building the space and providing sufficient incentives and resources for collaborative activities between them will require changes in government policy—itself not a straightforward endeavor. Moreover, the sharp human and financial resource constraints in developing countries compound the challenge. This brief describes some of the important barriers to effective collaboration between the two sectors and suggests ways to overcome them. First, though, why does policy matter in this context? Policy states how government intends to prioritize the allocation of resources under its control for what is perceived to be the best interest of society. Poor health and stagnant or declining agricultural productivity are among the most fundamental challenges to improved human welfare and economic growth. Government has the responsibility for providing many of the institutions, infrastructure, and resources — key public goods — without which many farmers, in particular, will remain unhealthy, unproductive, and mired in poverty. Thus the policies and actions of government are a critical component in enabling individuals, particularly in rural areas, to live healthier and more productive lives."" -- From text",Open Access,,"Benson, Todd",,127137.pdf,126926,,,,,,2012-05-16,2015-09-12,,,,,"IFPRI1

Because of the “public good” nature of agricultural research for developing countries, it was assumed that the private sector would not invest sufficiently in producing knowledge and technologies that contribute to rural development and poverty alleviation there. So public agencies and aid organizations have initiated and subsidized agricultural research and innovation to supplement the knowledge and technology produced by private entities. Yet many of these publicly generated improvements have not been useful to farmers, processors, and agribusiness and hence have not been adopted on a wide scale. Others have not been transferred to those who would have contentedly absorbed them. At the same time, the production and marketing technologies for the fastest-growing products, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, have been introduced mostly by the private sector. In this context, it is crucial to revisit the role the private sector can play in generating knowledge and technology for agricultural development. What functions do farm input providers, farmers, processors, traders, and exporters have in agricultural innovation processes, and how can they become more directly involved in the financing, generation, diffusion, and adoption of new knowledge and technologies?"" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Pomareda, Carlos

Traditionally, agricultural and health policies address specific goals within those sectors. Agricultural policies address conservation of the natural resource base, protection of farmers’ livelihoods, basic needs of the poor including food security, and the context for regulations on, among other things, food safety and the sound use of  pesticides. National public health policies are also sectorally driven and reflect the dichotomy in the health sector between preventive action and curative care... [A] conducive policy framework is essential for effective agriculture-health collaboration. This framework should be comprehensive, focus on strategic issues, be periodically reviewed and updated, and maintain criteria that recognize the bidirectional nature of the links.

Gains in food production have played a key role in feeding growing and malnourished populations. Yet they have not translated into a hunger-free world nor prevented the development of further nutritional challenges. Micronutrient deficiencies (for example, of vitamin A, iron, iodine, and zinc) are now recognized as being even more limiting for human growth, development, health, and productivity than energy deficits. Hunger among the poor also increasingly manifests itself through excessive consumption of energy-rich but nutrient-poor foods. The result is a double burden of undernutrition (deficiencies of energy, micronutrients, or both) and “overnutrition” (poor diet quality leading to obesity and other diet-related chronic illnesses).",Open Access,,"Todd, Ewen C.

Second, more careful scrutiny of national marketing and financial policies that influence farmer and middlemen income, and who benefits from agricultural export crops. Third, the design of some type of compensation fund for sudden or certain “losers” in globalization, who face loss of livelihood and recruitment to violence when cash crops like coffee fail to deliver expected livelihoods.

Others include dengue fever, yellow fever, and filariasis. Young children in poor communities are particularly affected: malaria is among the top five causes of death among under-fives in Sub-Saharan Africa; schistosomiasis among children affects growth, nutritional status, and cognitive development; and encephalitis occurs mainly in young children... Water development projects bring important benefits locally and globally. Yet it is often assumed that irrigation will bring health benefits to all, regardless of their socioeconomic standing within a community. In reality, the economic and social impacts of irrigation are diverse and widespread, and neither costs nor benefits are evenly distributed among community members. In Sub-Saharan Africa, as elsewhere in the world, there is increasing recognition of the need to reduce the negative impacts of agricultural development on ecosystems and peoples’ health. Unless well-targeted interventions are made, the most vulnerable—notably poor children and their mothers—will continue to benefit least from the promise of irrigation and suffer most from the adverse health impacts."" -- From text",Open Access,,"Mutero, Clifford M.

In Sub-Saharan Africa AIDS is affecting the rural landscape in ways that demand a rethinking of development policy and practice, and parts of South Asia may soon face a similar situation.... There is clearly tremendous scope for agricultural policy to become more HIV-responsive, both to further AIDS-related objectives and to help achieve agricultural objectives. Yet there are no magic bullets. Land-labor ratios and the relative degree of substitutability between household resources, among other factors, will determine the possible responses to HIV/AIDS. If policy becomes more HIV- responsive, it will stay relevant and effective.

Second, what is the spatial distribution of undernutrition in Tanzania?...The answer to the question of whether nutrition mapping is feasible is a qualified “yes.” Although the models of children’s nutritional status are not as successful as poverty mapping models at explaining variation, the spatial pattern of undernutrition at the district level seems plausible."" -- from Authors' Abstract",Open Access,,"Simler, Kenneth R.",,36531.cpd,36530,,,,,,2016-04-28,2016-04-28,,,,,"IFPRI1

970,"Trade liberalization is expected to act positively on development and poverty reduction... The traditional argument in favor of a positive relationship between liberalization and poverty reduction focuses on... [key] linkages. A large proportion of poor people work in the agricultural sector, where trade distortions are particularly high. Liberalization could lead to higher world agricultural prices and raise activity and remuneration in this sector in developing countries. The same beneficial outcome could occur in the textile and apparel sectors, where protection remains high and developing countries have a comparative advantage. But openness can also have negative effects. First, government transfers can shrink as liberalization cuts the government’s receipts of trade-related taxes. Second, terms of trade can deteriorate as liberalization affects world prices. Third, liberalization can impose adjustment costs and raise short-run risk owing to competition from imports and reallocation of productive factors. As a consequence, it is uncertain how much trade liberalization would reduce poverty, and many studies have attempted to assess the size of these benefits. The main empirical tool for this work is the multicountry computable general equilibrium (CGE) model—a sophisticated and complex tool of analysis that often appears as a “black box” from which results are difficult to understand.",Open Access,,"Bouët, Antoine",,44359.cpd,44123,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2499/Researchbrief05,10.2499/Researchbrief05,,2015-09-17,2015-09-17,,,,,"IFPRI1

971,"""Land is still among the most important assets of the rural population in the developing world. Land resources are governed by a variety of tenure systems based on statutory, customary, or religious law. At the same time, many national, subnational, and local institutions administer the application and enforcement of these laws, relying on a wide variety of policies, rules, and regulations that promote different practices for using and managing land and land-based resources. IFPRI contributes to land policy debates by demonstrating the importance of land policy and its impact on rural people. This occurs across multiple dimensions, including people’s livelihoods, the sustainability of the resource base, and the effectiveness of the institutions that govern land.

A new book, Information and Communication Technologies for Development and Poverty Reduction: The Potential of Telecommunications, published by the Johns Hopkins University Press for IFPRI, addresses several pressing questions surrounding ICTs. How do ICTs affect economic development in low-income countries? How do they affect poor people in these countries and in rural areas in particular? What policies and programs facilitate their potential to enhance development and the inclusion of poor constituents? The book presents researchers’ findings related to five critical questions. (1) What link exists between ICT growth and economic growth? (2) Do weak institutions block effective use of ICTs? (3) Have ICTs been adapted to low-income countries, and have they had an impact on SMEs? (4) Does household access to ICTs remain constrained?

The five areas for action are interlinked and would best work if pursued in conjunction. The authors emphasize investments with a human face that include and reach out to the rural poor and a reorientation of subsidies toward such investments:  1. India should increase investments in rural infrastructure including transport and information technology that connects villages) and agricultural R&D (leading to improved technologies for farmers). 2. India should reorient its social safety nets to create more employment in rural areas; help strengthen the human resource base through education, nutrition, and empowerment of women; and build physical infrastructure. 3. Water is going to be increasingly scarce. Investing large sums in new mega-irrigation schemes may not be the best course of action, but it is important to complete those in which a lot of money has already been invested. 4. India must liberalize its marketing and trade policies to encourage vertical coordination between farms, firms, and forks (supermarkets); facilitate increased flow of rural credit, especially to smallholders, through, say, nonbanking financial intermediaries; and withdraw any special concessions in support of foodgrain policies. 5. Trade liberalization in agriculture has the potential to bring rich dividends to developing countries, including India. To realize this potential, India must work toward establishing and strengthening a rules-based multilateral trading system through WTO negotiations.",Open Access,,"von Braun, Joachim

All three cases show limited long-term impact in the aggregate from either food for- work or free food distribution, although positive impacts were found for some groups of recipients in all three studies. The sparse average impacts appear to be related to quantity, timing, and targeting. Households received only small amounts of food aid, when compared with their total consumption. In addition, some of the transfers arrived months after the crisis began. In many instances, they were not regularly available or sustained for more than a season. And targeting was in many cases inconsistent or ambiguous as to whether to focus on the poorest or those most affected by crisis. -- From text",Open Access,,"Gilligan, Daniel O.

996,"The topic of family farms has been gaining prominence in the academic, policy, and donor communities in recent years. Small farms dominate the agricultural landscape in the developing world, providing the largest source of employment and income to the rural poor, yet smallholders remain highly susceptible to poverty and hunger. With the advance of globalization and greater integration of agricultural markets, the need for increases in agricultural productivity for family farms is particularly pressing. Raising productivity and output of small farmers would not only increase their incomes and food security, but also stimulate the rest of the economy and contribute to broad-based food security and poverty alleviation. In this paper, Michael Lipton builds an argument for greater focus on pro-smallholder crop science as a key solution to generate increases in productivity and income. Increasing the levels of investment into agricultural technology, improving water and land use and distribution, and creating positive incentives for developing-country farmers come to the forefront of the paper as critical steps that must be taken to ensure massive reduction in global poverty. Favorable demographic trends over the next few decades provide a window of opportunity for reforms and action that must not be squandered."" -- From Foreword by Joachim von Braun",Open Access,,"Lipton, Michael",,43283.pdf,47825,,,,,,2011-07-14,2022-10-26,,,,,"IFPRI1

997,"Given the number of undernourished people in the developing world and the increasingly complex risks to food security, policymakers are faced with an enormous agenda. Freeing people from hunger will require more and better-targeted investments, innovations, and policy actions, driven by a keen understanding of the dynamic risks and forces that shape the factors affecting people’s access to food and the links with nutrition.  The International Food Policy Research Institute’s (IFPRI’s) International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) provides insight into the management of these risks through appropriate policy actions. By projecting future global food scenarios to 2050, IMPACT explores the potential implications of policy action and inaction in several main risk areas as well as the effects on child  malnutrition in the developing world, commodity prices, demand, cereal yields, production, and net trade. In the progressive policy actions scenario, which assumes increased investment in rural development, health, education, and agricultural research and development, developing country governments and the international community are able to dramatically reduce the number of food-insecure people, leading to a worldwide decline in hunger. Under these conditions, Latin America and China are able to virtually eliminate child malnutrition by 2050. Bolstered by the development and dissemination of improved technologies and better infrastructure, crop production and yields increase in developing countries. Notably, the bulk of the growth in production is driven by yield increases rather than by expanding land area. Spurred by growth in the agricultural sector, average incomes in developing countries increase. Rising incomes  bolster demand for high-value agricultural products, such as meat, dairy, and fruits and vegetables; global livestock  production more than doubles, for example. Average per capita calorie supplies for developing countries exceed 3,400 per day, well in excess of minimum requirements. The policy failure scenario assumes greater political discord and more extensive agricultural protectionism, together with the failure of policies to deal with food emergencies related to conflict. Slow growth and trade restrictions lead to stagnation in average per capita calorie availability, which remains only slightly above minimum requirements until after 2030, when availability increases. In addition, crucial investments in  agriculture, rural development, and poverty reduction are forgone or displaced. Because of limited investment in agricultural research and technology, this scenario has a high level of crop area expansion as a result of relatively rapid population growth and slim yield improvements in developing countries. This scenario also results in flat maize prices, declining per capita cereal demand, falling beef prices, and relatively flat meat demand. As a result of the policies in this scenario, the number of malnourished children in developing countries rises between 1997 and 2015, after which there are only modest declines. In the technology and natural resource management failure scenario, yield growth falls even more than under the preceding scenario, forcing farmers to move into marginal producing areas, which causes a more rapid expansion of cereal area into less productive land that does not compensate for the yield shortfalls (and causes environmental degradation). As a result, cereal prices rise substantially through 2030 and then fall off only  gradually. Beef and other meat prices, which are affected by the price of feed, follow a similar pattern. Developing-country per capita calorie availability is essentially unchanged over 1997–2050 and remains at a barely adequate average level. Given unequal access to the food that is available, millions of people actually consume less than the minimum. The occurrence of child undernourishment is even higher than under the policy failure scenario in all developing-country regions. Overall, the technology and natural resource management failure scenario results in the worst impact on food security and child malnourishment in the developing world. The progressive policy scenario outlines several of the most crucial positive steps. National governments and the international community must assume a new focus on agricultural growth and rural development, along with increasing their investments in education, social services, and health. Policies to encourage synergistic growth in the nonfarm sectors are also needed to spur broad-based economic growth. Underpinning these strategies and research agendas must be a firm commitment to reducing hunger and improving the welfare of the world’s undernourished people."" -- From Authors' Executive Summary",Open Access,,"von Braun, Joachim

1000,"Food security in Africa has substantially worsened since 1970. Although the proportion of malnourished individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa has remained in the range of 33–35 percent since around 1970, the absolute number of malnourished people in Africa has increased substantially with population growth, from around 88 million in 1970 to an estimate of over 200 million in 1999–2001. Yet this discouraging trend need not be a blueprint for the future. New research from IFPRI shows that the policy and investment choices of African policymakers and the international development community can make an enormous difference for Africa’s future agricultural production and food  security. By modeling the results of a number of different policy scenarios in Africa through the year 2025, we show that the  number of malnourished children, one important indicator of food security, could rise as high as 41.9 million or fall as low as 9.4 million. These scenarios, therefore, shed light on the effectiveness of various policies and investments in assuring a food-secure future for Africa.",Open Access,,"Rosegrant, Mark W.

In this paper, they examine the impact of unequal income distribution on the ability of a community to finance local schools in South Africa. To this end, they conduct two analyses, one empirical and the other based on simulations... This study clearly shows that income inequality negatively affects school fees and pulls down the average quality of education, which adversely affects human capital in the next generation. Policy interventions are needed to stop this vicious cycle. Government subsidies must be increased to those communities that are trapped in a situation where they cannot collect sufficient school fees to maintain an adequate education system."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Yamauchi, Futoshi

1004,"Recent research has shown that improving women’s decisionmaking power relative to men’s within households leads to improvements in a variety of well-being outcomes for children. In South Asia, where the influence of women’s power is particularly strong, these outcomes include children’s nutritional status and the quality of feeding and health care practices. Focusing on nutritional status, this paper presents the results of a study investigating whether increases in women’s power have a stronger positive influence on the nutritional status of their daughters than their sons. If so, then increasing women’s power not only improves the well-being of children as a group, but also serves as a force to reduce long-standing discrimination that undermines female capabilities in many important areas of life as well as human and economic development in general. To investigate this issue, the study draws on Demographic and Health Survey data collected during the 1990s in four countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. The main empirical technique employed is multivariate regression analysis with statistical tests for significant differences in effects for girl and boy children. A total of 30,334 women and 33,316 children under three years old are included in the analysis. The study concludes that, for the South Asia region as a whole, an increase in women’s decisionmaking power relative to men’s, if substantial, would be an effective force for reducing discrimination against girl children. However, this finding is not applicable in all countries and for all areas and age groups of children. Indeed the study finds evidence that in some areas, for instance the northern and western states of India as a group, increasing women’s power would lead to a worsening of gender discrimination against girls. This is likely the result of deeply embedded son preference associated with highly patriarchal social systems. The lesson for policymakers and development practitioners is that while increasing women’s power is likely to improve the well-being of children, in some geographical areas it will not necessarily diminish discrimination against girls, which violates human rights and undermines the region’s economic development and the health of its population. In these areas, to overcome son preference, economic returns to girls will have to be increased and efforts to change customs regarding marriage and inheritance associated with patriarchal kinship systems, which favor males, will have to be made."" -- Authors' Abstract",Open Access,,"Smith, Lisa C.

1005,"We examine the spatial determinants of the prevalence of poverty for small spatially defined populations in rural Malawi. Poverty prevalence was estimated using a small-area poverty estimation technique. A theoretical approach based on the risk chain conceptualization of household economic vulnerability guided our selection of a set of potential risk and coping strategies — the determinants of our model — that could be represented spatially. These were used in two analyses to develop global and local models, respectively. In our global model—a spatial error model — only eight of the more than two dozen determinants selected for analysis proved significant. In contrast, all of the determinants considered were significant in at least some of the local models of poverty prevalence. The local models were developed using geographically weighted regression. Moreover, these models provided strong evidence of the spatial nonstationarity of the relationship between poverty and its determinants. That is, in determining the level of poverty in rural communities, where one is located in Malawi matters. This result for poverty reduction efforts in rural Malawi implies that such efforts should be designed for and targeted at the district and subdistrict levels. A national, relatively inflexible approach to poverty reduction is unlikely to enjoy broad success.",Open Access,,"Benson, Todd

In the poorest areas, such as western China and eastern India, the poverty reduction effect from these investments is particularly high.",Open Access,,"Fan, Shenggen

1008,"One of the common criticisms of poverty alleviation programs is that the high share of administrative (nontransfer) costs substantially reduces the programs’ impact on poverty.  But very little empirical evidence exists on program costs.  For example, a recent extensive international review of targeted poverty alleviation programs in developing countries could find data on costs for only 32 out of the 111 programs reviewed.  Even then, the numbers available were not always comparable.  In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the cost structure of a program recently introduced in Mexico, called PROGRESA.  Our analysis shows how cost data can be used as the basis for an evaluation of the cost efficiency of anti-poverty programs. It cautions, however,  that one must be very careful when interpreting cost numbers or undertaking comparisons across programs in order to avoid misleading conclusions.  Any credible analysis of a program’s cost efficiency must involve a detailed analysis of cost structure and not simply provide aggregate cost information.  We also highlight the importance of not neglecting private costs incurred by households in taking up transfers."" -- Authors' Abstract",Open Access,,"Coady, David

1009,"With high population density and limited land availability, Vietnam’s Red River Delta is undergoing a major transformation as its economic base moves away from subsistence farming towards intensive, high-value food production for export and local urban markets, and nonfarm employment. This paper  describes the changing livelihoods of the residents of two villages that represent two different pathways to local economic development. One village relies primarily on agricultural intensification and diversification, although in combination with nonfarm activities. These nonfarm activities are either supplementary (such as handicraft production and seasonal migration) or related to farming, such as provision of agricultural services, transport and trade of agricultural produce. To a large extent, it is this nonfarm income that allows investment in agriculture at the household level. Residents of the second village, although nominally still owning rice farms, have effectively moved out of agriculture and engage almost exclusively in handicraft production. Despite these major differences, there are also important similarities between the two villages. First, much of their recent economic development is linked to access to markets — including proximity to local urban centers and to Hanoi (where demand from urban consumers and from exporting enterprises has increased substantially), a vastly improved road and transport system, and an excellent  communications infrastructure. Second, each village has developed forward and backward linkages with their main production sector. Last but not least, local authorities have played an important role in supporting local economic development, providing infrastructure, training for handicraft production, and inputs for farmers. The long-term sustainability of economic growth and poverty reduction in the Red River Delta will largely depend on strengthening rural-urban linkages. This includes adopting regulations on land use that allow farmers to better respond to growing urban demand for high-value produce; incorporate more explicitly the needs of the handicraft micro-enterprises in existing and future policies and plans for rural industrialization; recognize and support the role of seasonal migration in rural local economic development; and address the changing planning and natural resource management needs of these urbanizing villages.""-- Authors' Abstract",Open Access,,"Thanh, Hoang Xuan

However, more than ever before, emerging local and global patterns such as the modern food value-chain led by supermarkets and food processors, rapid urbanization, changes in dietary composition, and enhanced information and communication technologies point to the need to pay close attention to the role of markets both in linking rural areas with intermediate cities and market towns and promotion of economic development and poverty reduction.  This paper begins with a presentation of a conceptual framework of market integration and then identifies five major factors that increase the transfer costs that subsequently hinder market integration between rural and urban areas: information asymmetry, transaction costs, transport and communication costs, policy induced barriers, and social and noneconomic factors. Five specific cases in five developing countries are examined in this study to demonstrate the primary sources of transfer costs and the aspects of market institutions that are important to market integration and promotion of rural-urban linkages."" -- from Authors' Abstract",Open Access,,"Chowdhury, Shyamal

In fact, it was so poor that mean per capita consumption was actually below the absolute poverty line. Between 1996 and 2002, however, the economy grew by 62 percent cumulatively. Although the poverty headcount declined from 69 to 54 percent, more than half of the population continued to live below the poverty line. The question then is to what extent has economic growth benefited the poor? Is it pro-poor? Although the term “pro-poor” is pervasive in the literature today, there is no consensus on its definition. This paper considers the pattern of growth across the entire income distribution."" -- From Text",Open Access,,"James, Robert C.

However, these estimates are necessarily at a high level of aggregation, because such surveys usually include only a few thousand households, with coarse spatial stratification. Larger databases, such as national censuses, provide sufficient observations for more disaggregated analysis, but typically collect very little socioeconomic information. This paper combines data from the 1996–97 Mozambique National Household Survey of Living Conditions with the 1997 National Population and Housing Census to generate small-area (subdistrict) estimates of welfare, poverty, and inequality, with the associated standard errors. These small-area estimates are then used to explore several  dimensions of poverty and inequality in Mozambique, particularly with regard to geographical targeting of antipoverty efforts. Reliably identifying and targeting the poor can be administratively costly, especially in rural Africa, where low population density and weak administrative capacity are common. Geographical targeting, or targeting poor areas, is sometimes proposed as a feasible alternative to targeting poor people, and poverty maps may serve as a valuable tool in this regard. Unfortunately, the notion of poor areas might not always be especially useful, as appears to be the case in Mozambique. The poverty maps do not reveal a particularly strong spatial concentration of poverty; the differences in poverty levels between areas tend to be subtle. This pattern is also observed in the decomposition of small-area inequality estimates, which shows that only about 20 percent of consumption inequality is accounted for by inequality between districts or between administrative posts. The picture that emerges of the poor living alongside the nonpoor indicates that targeting poor areas is likely to result in leakage to the nonpoor in that area, and considerable under-coverage of the significant numbers of poor households in areas that are less poor.”""-- Authors' Abstract",Open Access,,"Simler, Kenneth R.

Building on past and ongoing work on CDD, this study addresses the fundamental question: how can CDD initiatives motivate and empower the greatest number of communities to take control of their own development? What are the key contextual factors, institutional arrangements, capacity elements, and processes related to successful scaling-up of CDD, and, conversely, what are the main constraints or limiting factors, in different contexts? Drawing upon recent literature and the findings from five case studies, key lessons on how best to stimulate, facilitate, and support the scaling-up of CDD in different situations, along with some major challenges, are highlighted. Lessons include the need for donors and supporters of CDD, including governments, to think of the process beyond the project, and of transformation or transition rather than exit. Donor push and community pull factors need to be balanced to prevent ""supply-driven, demand-driven development."" Overall, capacity is pivotal to successful CDD and its successful scaling-up over time. Capacity is more than simply resources, however; it also includes motivation and commitment, which, in turn, require appropriate incentives at all levels. Capacity development takes time and resources, but it is an essential upfront and ongoing investment, with the capacity and commitment of facilitators and local leaders being particularly important. A ""learning by doing"" culture -- one that values adaptation, flexibility, and openness to change -- needs to be fostered at all levels, with time horizons adjusted accordingly. The building of a library of well-documented, context-specific experiences through good monitoring, evaluation, and operational research will be useful in advocating for improvements in the contextual environment. Ultimately, for CDD to be sustained, it should be anchored within existing contextual systems (government), frameworks (e.g., PRSP), and processes (decentralization), even where these are imperfect."" -- Author's Abstract",Open Access,,"Gillespie, Stuart",,43377.pdf,47919,,,,,,2011-07-14,2021-04-22,,,,,"IFPRI1

Here, we introduce an information theoretic approach for estimating utility-consistent poverty lines. An example of the approach is provided for the case of Mozambique.

However, past experience shows that means testing often reduces program participation of  eligible households—this is true even for universally available programs in developed countries. High non-take-up rates reflect the important role that self-selection patterns can play in program participation levels by different socioeconomic groups. Yet there is still very little empirical evidence on the nature and magnitude of the trade-offs between program coverage of the eligible population and targeting performance, especially for developing countries.

Using household panel data from a randomized community-based intervention carried out in both coffee- and noncoffee-growing areas, I examine the role of a conditional cash transfer program, the Red de Protección Social (RPS), during this downturn. While not designed as a traditional safety net program in the sense of reacting or adjusting to crises or shocks, RPS has performed like one, with larger estimated program effects for those who were more severely affected by the downturn. For example, it protected households against declines in per capita expenditures and, while not significantly depressing labor supply relative to before the program, muted additional labor supply for beneficiaries in coffee-growing areas, relative to their counterparts without the program. Beneficiaries who participated in the coffee industry as laborers before the program were more likely to have exited the coffee industry, whereas those who participated as producers were less likely to have exited. The findings are consistent with the existence of credit constraints inhibiting such transitions in the absence of the program. Overall, then, RPS appears to be playing an important part in the risk-coping strategies of households..""-- Authors' Abstract",Open Access,,"Maluccio, John",,43379.pdf,47921,,,,,,2011-07-14,2017-06-06,,,,,"IFPRI1

Though some safety nets had a developmental component, safety nets are still largely associated with the idea of a short-term buffer. “Social protection” is a newer term that incorporates safety net programs but also includes a role for renewed state involvement, emphasizes a longer-term developmental approach, includes social assistance and social insurance, and is often advocated as a right rather than a reactive form of relief. Social protection policy addresses not only programs aimed at reducing the impact of shocks and coping with their aftermath, but also interventions designed to prevent shocks and destitution in the first place. Most societies have private interhousehold, intrafamily, and intrahousehold transfers that promote resilience to shocks, mitigating their negative effects. However, in countries or communities where people are universally poor, there is less to share, particularly in times of shocks that affect all or many in the society (such as drought, floods, AIDS, or widespread structural  unemployment) — which is precisely when the need for help is most critical."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Adato, Michelle

As a result, more than a third of African children suffer stunted growth and face a range of physical and cognitive challenges not faced by their better fed peers. Ultimately, undernutrition underlies around 2.9 million deaths in Africa annually — more than a quarter of all the deaths occurring on the continent each year. The economic costs of such widespread undernutrition are enormous. This is because the economic growth of each nation — which requires enhanced economic productivity — depends upon broad improvements being made in the intellectual and technical capacity of its population. But, this in turn depends upon people receiving adequate nutrition, particularly women in their childbearing years and young children. So, only once African countries have secured the basic food and nutritional needs of their populations will they be able to achieve the broad-based economic growth necessary to reduce."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Benson, Todd",,73132.cpd,73131,,,,,,2015-09-12,2015-09-12,,,,,"IFPRI1

They  look at the implications of market orientation for small-scale agricultural producers and the implications of integration for small farms and firms. They conclude that agroindustrialization, which is changing agriculture and rural communities in developing countries, forces farmers and entrepreneurs to change the way they do business. Collective action and networking, a better understanding of how to develop and support those networks, and less traditional forms of organization, such as agricultural cooperatives, is necessary for the development of an efficient and equitable agribusiness sector. -- from Text",Open Access,,"Johnson, Nancy

African governments and the donor community have recognized this potential and have pledged to help generate agricultural progress. This policy brief considers recent trends in poverty, malnutrition, and growth; outlines some of the challenges to boosting agricultural growth; and highlights cases of agricultural success in specific countries. By learning from case studies of smallholder success and building on the new enthusiasm of African governments, donors and their African partners can ensure that agriculture's role in meeting the MDGs is fully realized."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Runge, C.

1057,"""In Africa and elsewhere, safety nets were promoted in the 1980s as a response to the (presumably short-term) adverse effects of structural adjustment. Though some safety nets had a developmental component, safety nets are still largely associated with the idea of a short-term buffer. “Social protection” is a newer term that incorporates safety net programs but also includes a role for renewed state involvement, emphasizes a longer-term developmental approach, includes social assistance and social insurance, and is often advocated as a right rather than a reactive form of relief. Social protection policy addresses not only programs aimed at reducing the impact of shocks and coping with their aftermath, but also interventions designed to prevent shocks and destitution in the first place. Most societies have private interhousehold, intrafamily, and intrahousehold transfers that promote resilience to shocks, mitigating their negative effects. However, in countries or communities where people are universally poor, there is less to share, particularly in times of shocks that affect all or many in the society (such as drought, floods, AIDS, or widespread structural  unemployment) — which is precisely when the need for help is most critical."" -- from Text",Open Access,,"Adato, Michelle

This brief examines those cases where technology is not the answer and where farmer collaboration of farmers is the essential element in successful management of pests. The author writes, Because of the transboundary nature of many pest problems, technical solutions?whether based on the use of pesticides or on biological principles?are rarely sufficient.  She concludes that extension programs, like farmer field schools, should (1) promote an understanding of the spatial dimensions of pest ecology and (2) provide communication techniques that will enable groups of farmers to approach neighboring farmers to invite them to take part in coordinated pest management. -- from Text.",Open Access,,"Ravnborg, Helle Munk",,129515.pdf,129304,,,,,,2015-08-06,2022-08-09,,,,,"IFPRI1

A number of farmer-led research and extension (FRE) approaches incorporate collective action for different purposes and at different stages in the innovation process. Collective action can be useful in sharing knowledge, setting priorities, and experimenting with, evaluating, and disseminating technologies.

The author describes the different  faces of the landed poor and then take up the issue of strengthening the property rights of  these groups, offering guidelines for tenure reform.  Institutionalizing these tenure reforms is essential. The author concludes that strengthening the property rights of the poor is a complex project. The landed poor are a heterogeneous group who hold rights to their landed assets in diverse and complicated ways. Efforts to increase the security of their tenure need to be sensitive to the specific circumstances that characterize each case, the existing legal conditions, the strength or weakness of available financial and property registration systems, the needs of each group of stakeholders, and the possibilities of unintended consequences. Common property rights must also be protected.",Open Access,,"Bruce, John W.",,129525.pdf,129314,,,,,,2015-08-06,2016-04-29,,,,,"IFPRI1

1073,"The author tells us that Collective action occurs when more than one individual is required to contribute to an effort in order to achieve an outcome. People living in rural areas and using natural resources engage in collective action on a daily basis when they  plant or harvest food together;  use a common facility for marketing their products;  maintain a local irrigation system or patrol a local forest to see that users are following rules; and  meet to decide on rules related to all of the above. Frequently, however, it becomes difficult to exclude nonparticipants from benefiting from the collective action of others. This situation creates a collective action problem for the participants. When individuals seek out short-term benefits for themselves alone, they are better off when others contribute to the collective action and they do not. In this case, they benefit without paying the costs. Of course, if all individuals pursue short-term, self-centered benefits, no collective benefits are achieved. She then discusses  how participants can overcome the collective action problems they face and the resource system attributes and the participant attributes that aid in overcoming these problems. -- from Text.",Open Access,,"Ostrom, Elinor",,129527.pdf,129316,,,,,,2015-08-06,2020-08-20,,,,,"IFPRI1

Achieving efficient, equitable, and sustainable rangeland management depends on the costs and benefits of alternative systems. These costs and benefits, in turn, depend on agroecological, sociocultural, and economic characteristics. The conservation and management of rangelands require not only tenure security, but also an understanding of local livestock production and risk management strategies and factors that promote collective action, which can then be integrated into national policy formulation strategies and project designs. -- from Text.",Open Access,,"Ngaido, Tidiane

The author argues that unless the government actively strengthens its support to former Black schools in allocating both budget and personnel, a vicious cycle of poverty and low-quality education will persist. The worry is that children who do not receive a sufficiently high quality of education are less likely to engage in regular employment and are more likely to suffer from low wages, potentially contributing to the long-term poverty trap.",Open Access,,"Yamauchi, Futoshi",,43380.pdf,47922,,,,,,2011-07-14,2015-07-22,,,,,"IFPRI1

Although traditional matrilineal inheritance rules deny landownership rights to women, women have increasingly acquired land through gifts and other means, thereby reducing the gender gap in landownership. The gender gap in schooling has also declined significantly, though it persists. We attribute such changes to the increase in women's bargaining power due to an agricultural technology that increased the demand for women's labor, contributing to the reduction of ""social"" discrimination as well as weak ""parental"" discrimination.",Open Access,,"Quisumbing, Agnes R.

These included supplementing income to increase  household expenditures on food, reducing primary school desertion, and improving the health care and nutritional status of children under age 5. The evaluation design is based on a randomized, community-based intervention with measurements  before and after the intervention in both treatment and control communities. Where possible, we erred on the side of assessing effects in conservative manners, for example, in the calculation of standard errors and the treatment of possible control group contamination. Overall, we find that RPS had positive (or favorable) and significant double-difference estimated average effects on a broad range of indicators and outcomes. Where it did not, it was often due to similar, smaller improvements in the control group that appear to have been stimulated indirectly by the program. Most of the estimated effects were larger for the extreme poor. The findings presented here played an important role in the decision to continue this effective program.",Open Access,,"Maluccio, John

One potential determinant is assortative matching, whereby the rich marry the rich and the poor marry the poor, generating a positive correlation between assets brought to marriage by both spouses. Another determinant explored is compensating parental transfers at marriage, whereby parents reduce assets transferred to their marrying children if their spouses bring more. The third determinant analyzed is parents' strategic behavior to improve the marriage-market ranking of their children by transferring more assets to them at the time of marriage.",Open Access,,"Fafchamps, Marcel

It also discusses some potential threats to and trade-offs of scaling up Kudumbashree. This report draws primarily upon the available literature and qualitative data collected during a five-day visit to Kudumbashree in March 2003....Our findings show that an enabling environment, especially decentralization and the concurrent devolution of finances to the local government bodies (LGBs), was critical in scaling up Kudumbashree. The CDS structures are now considered as a further step  to decentralization. As the CDS structures are affiliated to the LGBs, their financial sustainability is ensured through various modalities, e.g., convergence, women's component plan, and earmarked assistance to women's self-help groups (SHG). The unique context of Kerala, coupled with leadership of a few motivated and innovative officials, was key in both the decentralization and scaling-up process.",Open Access,,"Kadiyala, Suneetha",,43376.pdf,47918,,,,,,2011-07-14,2015-07-22,,,,,"IFPRI1

(SC), to combat HIV/AIDS in Malawi. It also discusses potential threats to and contextual factors limiting scaling up of STEPs. The report draws primarily upon the available literature and qualitative data collected during a five-day visit to SC Malawi in December 2002. STEPs started in 1995 as Community-Based Options for Protection and Empowerment (COPE). COPE was a service-delivery program in Mangochi District to assist children affected by HIV/AIDS. Through evaluations, SC realized that such an approach was unsustainable, not cost-effective, and not scalable. Based on the recommendations of the evaluations and on field experience, the program changed course to mobilize collective action to combat the epidemic. Working in the Namwera community in Mangochi under the National AIDS Commission (NAC), STEPs revitalized the dormant decentralized AIDS committees and their technical subcommittees at the district, community, and village levels. Based on the positive experience in Namwera, the program changed its initial strategy to that of an external change agent, assisting communities with community mobilization and capacity building so that communities became empowered to act collectively to address their problems. Village AIDS committees (VACs) first identify the vulnerable. Then VACs plan responses on the basis of the nature and magnitude of vulnerability within the villages, needs of the vulnerable, and capacity within villages to respond. The committees also monitor activities and mobilize resources. As the needs of the most affected communities are crosscutting, the program has become truly multisectoral, with activities along the continuum of prevention, care, support, and mitigation. STEPs has also been influencing national policies related to HIV/AIDS and children.",Open Access,,"Kadiyala, Suneetha",,43386.pdf,47928,,,,,,2011-07-14,2023-03-01,,,,,"GRP25

Both NUBL and NABARD groups use self-regulation (peer selection, peer monitoring, and peer enforcement of contracts) as key to gaining access to services not otherwise available to them.... The NABARD experience is government-led. NUBL, on the other hand, was established as an alternative to government action. In both cases, government policy in the form of mandatory ""priority sector"" credit played --and continues to play --a critical role in facilitating expansion. The subsidy content (explicit and implicit) of both NUBL and the NABARD program is quite high, and continued expansion of both programs is highly conditional on whether the policy regime of directed credit continues. Any change in this policy will deal a severe blow to both of these institutions.",Open Access,,"Sharma, Manohar",,43389.pdf,47931,,,,,,2011-07-14,2015-07-22,,,,,"IFPRI1

1086,"While ample evidence documents that urban children generally have better nutritional status than their rural counterparts, recent research suggests that urban malnutrition is on the rise. The environment, choices, and opportunities of urbanites differ greatly from those of rural dwellers' from employment conditions to social and family networks to access to health care and other services. Given these differences, understanding the relative importance of the various determinants of child malnutrition in urban and rural areas -- and especially whether they differ -- is key to designing context-relevant, effective program and policy responses for stemming malnutrition. This study uses Demographic and Health Survey data from 36 developing countries to address the question of whether the socioeconomic determinants of child nutritional status differ across urban and rural areas. The purpose is to answer the broader question of why child malnutrition rates are lower in urban areas. The socioeconomic determinants examined are women's education, women's status, access to safe water and sanitation, and household economic status. The analysis finds little evidence of differences in the nature of the socioeconomic determinants or in the strength of their associations with child nutritional status across urban and rural areas. As expected, however, it documents marked differences in the levels of these determinants in favor of urban areas. Large gaps in favor of urban areas are also found in the levels of key proximate determinants of child nutritional status, especially maternal prenatal and birthing care, quality of complementary feeding, and immunization of children. The conclusion is that better nutritional status of urban children is probably due to the cumulative effect of a series of more favorable socioeconomic conditions, which, in turn, seems to lead to better caring practices for children and their mothers. Given that the nature of the determinants of child nutritional status is largely the same across urban and rural areas, the same program and policy framework can be used to stem malnutrition in both. Efforts to alleviate the most critical socioeconomic constraints specific to the different environments should continue to be prioritized.",Open Access,,"Smith, Lisa C.

It employs a community-based approach to carry out three types of activities: social empowerment (institution building at the local level), personal empowerment (microfinance), and infrastructure improvement (mostly water supply schemes). PROSPECT has attempted to carry out these activities largely through its support of area-based organizations (ABOs) that now form part of city government. The zone development committees (ZDCs) and residents' development committees (RDCs) are the basic components of the ABO structure. These are community-level representations of municipal government; they are the community's mechanisms for expressing its voice and driving development. PROSPECT is itself an extension of an earlier project, PUSH II (Peri-Urban Self-Help Project). PUSH II and PROSPECT are fundamentally about developing community-based and community-driven development (CDD) mechanisms and strengthening community capacities to identify and respond to community needs. The paper examines the scaling-up experience of PUSH II and PROSPECT, looking especially at the mechanisms of CDD, the ABOs.",Open Access,,"Garrett, James L.",,43392.pdf,47934,,,,,,2011-07-14,2017-10-07,,,,,"GRP25

1088,"This paper explores risk sharing in the Zone Lacustre, Mali, as viewed through the lens of consumption smoothing. We find that idiosyncratic shocks appear to have little impact on consumption, and that households respond to these shocks in a variety of ways. In general, nonpoor households are more likely to enter into new income-generating activities while poor households are more likely to engage in credit or gift exchange or to ration consumption. When we construct a stronger test for consumption smoothing, we find that changes in household income lead to modest changes in consumption. Covariant shocks, as measured by village/round dummies, always lead to changes in consumption. These results are robust to concerns regarding bias resulting from measurement error or endogeneity of changes in income. Lastly, we find that households with access to improved water control infrastructure are less vulnerable than those that rely on rainfall or the flooding of the Niger River.",Open Access,,"Harrower, Sarah

Reviewing the literature, but also using data from household surveys conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and others in five countries of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, this paper profiles urban employment in developing-country cities. It highlights some often-overlooked aspects of urban conditions, most especially the importance of agriculture, the continuing importance of the formal sector, and seasonality of income, even among those not connected to agriculture. It also examines the connections between poverty and employment; looks at where people work and what they do; and highlights the importance of personal networks, the informal sector, and the concerns of women. Finally, it notes some dynamic forces shaping the future of urban employment and suggests some guidelines for policies and programs.",Open Access,,"Garrett, James L.",,43394.pdf,47936,,,,,,2011-07-14,2015-09-30,,,,,"IFPRI1

The emerging consensus is that renewed broadbased economic growth is a necessary condition for alleviating poverty, but in isolation this is insufficient. Effective social safety nets are also important components of any comprehensive poverty alleviation strategy. Existing social safety nets, however, suffer from shortcomings: they often fail to reach the intended target group, they fail to generate a sustained decrease in poverty, they often involve many uncoordinated or duplicative transfer programs, they can be inefficient and costly, and the transfers are often too small.",Open Access,,"Coady, David",,43395.pdf,47937,,,,,,2011-07-14,2015-07-22,,,,,"GRP28

Subsequent smallholder growth began slowly in the 1950s and 1960s, spurred by rapidly growing cash incomes in rural areas, which stimulated steadily rising demand for milk.""

Drawing lessons from past success requires identifying a range of successful and less successful episodes and then studying and comparing them. To identify a broad range of successful episodes in African agriculture, our analytical team launched an expert survey, polling more than 1,000 African agriculture specialists. In conducting this review, we defined 'success' as: a significant, durable change in agriculture resulting in an increase in agriculturally derived aggregate income, together with reduced poverty and/or improved environmental quality. From the responses, we, together with our advisory group, selected a dozen successful episodes for in-depth review and dispatched case study teams to investigate them. Although these episodes differ widely in terms of instigators of change, points of intervention, levels of subsidy involved, food and export crops, regional diversity, duration, and scale achieved, they suggest ways in which past sucesses can be replicated and scaled up.",Open Access,,"Haggblade, Steven",,129972.pdf,129761,,,,,,2015-11-05,2015-11-05,,"Haggblade, Steven. 2004.

In both research and marketing, Mali has benefited from collaboration with regional cotton networks that have achieved important scale economies for many small countries in the region....

In the second half of the century, newly independent governments launched support programs that greatly expanded smallholder production, leading to substantial production surges of 10 to 20 years in duration. Today, after widespread adoption by both commercial farmers and smallholders, farmers now plant 58 percent of all  maize area in East and Southern Africa to new high-yielding varieties, which on average outyield traditional varieties by 40-50 percent even without fertilizer....Though these maize-breeding efforts were an undeniable technical success, broader efforts to support national production growth proved fiscally unsustainable, and once heavy subsidies were withdrawn, production fell (see table).

Notably absent from the group of nonprofit insti-tutes seeking patent protection are the 16 centers of the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR). Located primarily in developing countries, only a few centers have obtained patent protection for their inventions. Nonprofit research institutions are not in the business of selling products to con-sumers. If they are to realize a return on their investment, they must sell rights to their technologies to commercial entities or other research institutions rather than make them freely available.

Improving food safety is an essential element of improving food security, which exists when populations have access to sufficient and healthy food. At the same time, as food trade expands throughout the world, food safety has become a shared concern among both  developed and developing countries. Governments in many countries have established new institutions, standards, and methods for regulating food safety and have increased investments in hazard control. This set of policy briefs describes how developing countries are addressing food safety issues in order to improve both food security and food trade, and discusses the risks, benefits, and costs when such policies are implemented.",Open Access,,"Unnevehr, Laurian J., ed.",,92803.cpd,95132,,,,,,2022-11-18,2022-11-18,,,,53320633; 64695217,"IFPRI1

Events like this spurred worldwide efforts to greatly expand the amount of agricultural biodiversity conserved in genebanks. More recently, microarray and other modern biotechnologies that provide new and less costly ways of screening crop samples for useful traits have increased the value of conserved genetic resources and focused worldwide attention on access to and use rights of traditional crop varieties, or landraces, stored in situ (place of origin) or in ex situ genebanks worldwide.",Open Access,,"Koo, Bonwoo

Improving food safety is an essential element of improving food security, which exists when populations have access to sufficient and healthy food. At the same time, as food trade expands throughout the world, food safety has become a shared concern among both  developed and developing countries. Governments in many countries have established new institutions, standards, and methods for regulating food safety and have increased investments in hazard control.

Events like this spurred worldwide efforts to greatly expand the amount of agricultural biodiversity conserved in genebanks. More recently, microarray and other modern biotechnologies that provide new and less costly ways of screening crop samples for useful traits have increased the value of conserved genetic resources and focused worldwide attention on access to and use rights of traditional crop varieties, or landraces, stored in situ (place of origin) or in ex situ genebanks worldwide.",Open Access,,"Koo, Bonwoo

Improvements in height-for-age in preschoolers are associated with increased height as a young adult and number of grades of schooling completed.

Building on the recent literature of consumption smoothing and risk sharing, the degree of consumption insurance is defined by the degree to which the growth rate of household consumption covaries with the growth rate of household income. All the case studies show that food consumption is better insured than nonfood consumption from idiosyncratic shocks. Adjustments in nonfood consumption appear to act as a mechanism for partially insuring ex-post the consumption of food from the effects of income changes. Food consumption is also more likely to be covered by informal insurance arrangements at the community level than nonfood consumption. Linkages among consumption variability, the level of household consumption, the incidence of poverty, and the probability of being ever poor and the proportion of time spent in poverty are also explored for Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Russia. All the case studies also show that households use a portfolio of risk-coping strategies, but that different types of households may have differential ability to use these strategies. In particular, poorer households may be less able to use mechanisms that rely to initial wealth as collateral. In this regard, public transfer programs may have a more redistributive effect.",Open Access,,"Skoufias, Emmanuel

1141,"The paper examines, taking into account the urban-rural divides, the changes and welfare implications of income diversification in Zimbabwe following macroeconomic policy changes and droughts of the early 1990s. Data from two comparable national income, consumption, and expenditure surveys in 1990/91 and 1995/96 show that the percentage of households earning income from private and informal sources grew considerably while that from government and formal sources declined. In general, rural households tend to have a more diversified portfolio of income compared to urban and the degree of income diversification decreases with the level of urbanization. However, there are important differences in the level of diversification within the rural and urban areas, depending on wealth: while the relatively better-off households have a more diversified income base in rural areas, it is the poor that pursue multiple income sources in urban areas. A decomposition of changes in welfare indicates that the total contribution of income diversification is large and increased between 1990/91 and 1995/96 in both urban and rural areas. On the other hand, there were significant declines in returns to human and physical capital assets during the same period. The findings suggest that households with a more diversified income base are better able to withstand the unfavorable impacts of the policy changes and weather shocks. The fact that relatively better-off households have a more diversified income base following the shocks implies that the poor are more vulnerable to economic changes unaccompanied by well-designed safety nets.",Open Access,,"Ersado, Lire",,43408.pdf,47950,,,,,,2011-07-14,2015-02-18,,,,,"IFPRI1

Given the potential benefits resulting from agriculture-based nutrition interventions, this study uses Q methodology to explore the views of a range of stakeholders from both developed and developing countries on the value of—and constraints related to—gender-sensitive, nutrition-oriented agricultural projects.  The three distinct viewpoints that emerge from this exercise all support the use of agricultural strategies to improve nutrition and underline the importance of gender-sensitive approaches.  The viewpoints differ, however, on the relative importance of nutrition education, the strategic use of nutrient supplementation and food fortification, and the degree to which agriculture-based approaches have an impact on nutrition.  The findings indicate that there is common ground among a range of stakeholders—donors, researchers, policymakers, and program practitioners—on the benefits of agriculture and gender-sensitive strategies to improve nutrition.  These areas of agreement can serve as a foundation for forging an effective integrative strategy to improve nutrition that includes gender-sensitive agricultural approaches.",Open Access,,"Levin, Carol E.

1143,"This study examines the poverty reduction implications of the introduction of three different agricultural technologies by government and NGOs in three rural sites across Bangladesh. The first is new vegetable seeds developed by AVRDC introduced in Saturia to women owning small amounts of land by a local NGO, based on a training and credit dissemination approach. The second is polyculture fish technology developed by WorldFish Center and introduced by a government extension program based on private fishponds operated mostly by men in Mymensingh. The third is the same polyculture fish technology, but introduced through a local NGO in Jessore based on the arrangement of leased fishponds operated by groups of low income women, supported by training and credit provision. The study found a number of significant poverty impacts.  Among the strongest was in the case of the vegetable technology, which is targeted towards women in households with relatively small amounts of land and is a ‘non-lumpy’ technology requiring a very low level of investment, but with proportionately significant returns and positive impacts on female empowerment and child nutritional status. The private fishpond technology was less successful in terms of poverty impact, since only better-off households tend to own ponds.  This technology, however, had positive effects on the pond and crop profits of these households.  The operation of the group fishpond technology, though a potentially beneficial agricultural program for poor households, was significantly undermined by collective action problems. Relative to women who did not have access to this group-based program, female group members appeared to have more mobility, greater likelihood of working for pay, higher off-farm incomes, and better nutritional status.  The group fishpond technology was found also to increase vulnerability in a number of ways, such as through the theft of fish from ponds, or through gendered intra-household inequalities in (a) technology-related time burdens and (b) access to markets for and hence income from the agricultural outputs produced. The study overall showed a higher level of trust for NGO as opposed to government services, but also highlighted the variable performance of NGOs. Political dimensions to NGO activity also emerged as important, and are perceived by some sections of the community to affect the dissemination of technologies and extension support services for the technologies. Quantitative and qualitative data were found to complement each other well in the research across a range of issues. For example, the survey addressed female empowerment adopters by measuring the frequency of women’s attendance of meetings etc, while the focus groups revealed the importance non-monetary exchange of vegetables between households to maintain social networks and reduce vulnerability. There were also gains through the overall use of the sustainable livelihoods framework as a way of sharpening understanding of the different entry points at which technology can impact on household well-being and vulnerability.",Open Access,,"Hallman, Kelly

It does this by assessing both the direct adoption of improved varieties and examining the process of their ""creolization."""" By exposing improved varieties to their conditions and management, continually selecting seed of these varieties for replanting, and in some cases promoting their hybridization with landraces, either by design or by accident, farmers produce what they recognize as ""creolized"" varieties. Our key hypothesis is that poor farmers benefit from improved germplasm through creolization. Creolization provides farmers with new options, as they deliberately modify an improved technology generated by the formal research system to suit their own circumstances and needs. Different methodologies such as participatory methods, ethnography, household case studies, a household sample survey, and a collection and agronomic evaluation of maize samples were used. This study was carried out in two regions: the coast of Oaxaca and the Frailesca in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, two of the poorest in Mexico. While one study area is subsistence-oriented and the other commercial, in both, extreme poverty is pervasive. Maize continues to play a key role in the livelihoods of the poor in both study areas.",Open Access,,"Bellon, Mauricio R.

1145,"This study is part of a larger effort to explore the impact of agricultural research on poverty reduction. It examines the diffusion and impact of hybrid maize in selected resettlement areas of rural Zimbabwe, paying particular attention to varieties made widely available from the mid-1990s onwards. While ""Zimbabwe's Green Revolution"" of the early 1980s was characterized by the widespread adoption of hybrid maize varieties and significant increases in yields, the subsequent diffusion of newer varieties occurred more slowly and had a more modest impact.  Several factors account for this. Government now plays a much-reduced role and one that increasingly focuses on ""better farmers."" Private-sector institutions that have entered the maize sector operate mainly in areas of high agricultural potential. Consequently, ""adoption"" partly reflects ""choice"" but also the (sometimes) limited physical availability of varieties. A further factor is the nature of the technology being introduced. Newer varieties are bred to meet the evolving needs of commercial farmers, but these new needs -- most notably improved disease resistance -- are not shared by the farmers in our survey and are not associated with significantly higher yields where use of fertilizers is limited. A further consideration is that information is disseminated via multiple channels and in a fragmentary fashion in an environment where tolerance of dissent is limited, the behavior of neighbors is viewed suspiciously and some actors involved in dissemination (such as extension workers) are increasingly viewed with mistrust. The presumption that farmers ""learn from each other"" is less applicable in circumstances such as these. Our case studies indicate links between the production of maize in excess of subsistence needs, the accumulation of assets such as livestock and tools, payment of school fees, and the acquisition of inputs such as fertilizer and labor for the subsequent cropping season. This coincides with the views of farmers who see high-yielding varieties of maize as an influential factor in raising livelihood above the level of poverty that prevailed when they first moved into the area. However, new varieties appear to have increased incomes only marginally. When we control for farmer characteristics and the endogeneity of adoption, use of these new varieties increases crop incomes only by about 10 percent; a 10-percent increase in maize income is associated with an increase in livestock holdings ranging from 4 to 12 percent. However, these modest impacts result in an improved ability to deal with vulnerability. Hybrids do raise productivity in maize production. Higher income from maize, and from other crops, leads to investment in livestock. And livestock holdings are an important means through which child health is protected when drought occurs. All such changes are associated with an improvement in well-being and a reduction in poverty.",Open Access,,"Bourdillon, Michael

In Ethiopia, a drought-stricken economy with one of the lowest per capita incomes in the world, food aid has amounted to almost 10 million metric tons (mt) from 1984 to 1998, almost 10 percent of annual cereal production. Because of the importance of food aid in Ethiopia, much effort has been devoted to evaluation of its effectiveness.....Many evaluations of food aid have examined its impact on household calorie availability. This paper focuses on the effects of food aid on individual nutritional status, as measured by indicators of child nutrition.",Open Access,,"Quisumbing, Agnes R.",,43404.pdf,47946,,,,,,2011-07-14,2018-04-28,,,,,"IFPRI1

1148,"There is hardly need these days to repeat that HIV/AIDS is devastating African societies and economies, threatening the hard-won human development gains of the past several decades. The changes to the development landscape wrought by AIDS demand a review of existing development actions at many levels, from households seeking to secure viable livelihoods, to policymakers attempting to better understand and internalize the implications of AIDS for their own sectoral goals and strategies. In this paper, we describe processes of understanding and responding that are needed for HIV/AIDS to be effectively addressed. Key concepts of resistance and resilience are illustrated through a discussion of the two-way interactions between food insecurity and HIV/AIDS, and their implications for the ways in which affected households, communities, and sectors may best respond.  One major set of responses is required from the agriculture sector, as the need to secure and provision food for populations affected by HIV/AIDS is rapidly increasing as the impact waves hit. Food is the first priority of many people affected by the pandemic. We are also beginning to learn more about the crucial role of nutritional status--both in terms of susceptibility to HIV infection and transmission and in terms of the quality and quantity of life of HIV-positive individuals. A sea change is required--in attitudes and consciousness of what HIV/AIDS is doing at different levels and the pathways through which it moves through societies. Such a new awareness may be facilitated by the use of an 'HIV/AIDS lens' -- essentially a tool for reviewing situations and development actions from the perspective of our evolving knowledge of AIDS interactions. The lens will facilitate the development of more HIV-relevant policies and programs of more sectors--and ultimately in larger scale, sustained progress in responding to AIDS. While the specifics will become clear through use of the lens, external support will likely be most effective in the long run where it is directed to preserving and developing institutional capacities to strengthen resistance and resilience.",Open Access,,"Loevinsohn, Michael E.

1149,"Flooding is a normal part of the ecology of Bangladesh. The 1998 flood was especially serious because of its depth and duration. At its peak, the flood covered two-thirds of the country, causing severe damage to the rice crop and threatening the food security of millions of households. Total rice production losses exceeded 2 million tons—about 10 percent of annual consumption. In sharp contrast to earlier flood disasters, particularly that of 1974, no major food crisis occurred. Instead, large-scale, private-sector imports, made possible by trade liberalization in the early 1990s, stabilized rice markets. Government food transfers to poor households also limited the impact of the flood on household access to food. This paper sheds light on the contribution of price stabilization to household food security following a major natural shock through estimates of the impact of rice prices and other factors on calorie consumption in 1998 and 1999. More broadly, the paper examines the components of the public and private response that prevented a major food crisis.",Open Access,,"del Ninno, Carlo

It is increasing human mortality and disease burdens, and it is lowering economic productivity. The dietary transition is driven by changing preferences fueled by growing incomes, changing relative prices, urbanization, and food technology and distribution systems. This paper identifies policy options from the food supply and demand sides that can influence the transition toward increasingly healthy outcomes. These options have had mixed success in industrialized countries, and the policy tradeoffs in the developing world will be even more complicated. Additional technical research is needed to assess competing risks and help develop policy options. There is also a need for research to engage different actors in the policymaking process. In a debate in which much is at stake, there is a potentially powerful role for researchers to bring these actors to the table.",Open Access,,"Haddad, Lawrence James",,43399.pdf,47941,,,,,,2011-07-14,2023-08-16,,,,,"IFPRI1

1152,"This paper as exemplified by the Millennium Declaration of the United Nations, the reduction of poverty and hunger are now seen as central objectives of international development. Yet the modalities for attaining these goals are contested. Further, while it might be assumed that interventions that alleviate poverty will automatically reduce hunger, a number of studies of the relationship between income and the acquisition of food suggest that this assumption may be incorrect. There are sharply divergent views as to how much narrowly targeted interventions actually benefit the poor. These result from differing assessments of three issues: whether better targeting outcomes are likely to be achieved, whether such methods are cost-effective, and whether the living standards of the poor are improved by such targeted interventions. This paper contributes to this debate through an analysis of a Mexican antipoverty program called PROGRESA (the Programa de Educación, Salud y Alimentación). PROGRESA provides cash transfers linked to children's enrollment and regular school attendance and to clinic attendance. By 2000, it reached approximately 2.6 million families, about 40 percent of all rural families and about one-ninth of all families in Mexico. We use a longitudinal sample of approximately 24,000 households from 506 communities....  We find that the impact is greatest on dietary quality as measured by the acquisition of calories from vegetable and animal products -- a finding consistent with the view of respondents themselves that PROGRESA was enabling them to to eat better.",Open Access,,"Hoddinott, John F.

How is dietary diversity conceptualized, operationalized, and measured, and how does it relate operationally to dietary quality?; 2. Is there an association between dietary diversity and nutrient adequacy in developing countries? Between dietary diversity and child growth?; 3. What is the relationship between household-level dietary diversity and socioeconomic factors and food security?; 4.

1154,"For a number of reasons, progress in improving child feeding practices in the developing world has been remarkably slow. First, complementary feeding practices encompass a number of interrelated behaviors that need to be addressed simultaneously. Child feeding practices are also age-specific within narrow age ranges, which add to the complexity of developing recommendations and measuring responses. Finally, the lack of  clear international recommendations for some aspects of complementary feeding has prevented the development of universal indicators to define optimal feeding. Without appropriate measurement tools, the design and evaluation of programs to improve complementary feeding practices cannot move forward. The present paper is the first systematic attempt at filling this gap. It puts forth a framework for the development of indicators of complementary feeding practices and proposes a series of possible indicators to measure some of the most critical aspects of infant and young child feeding. The emphasis is on simple indicators for use in large surveys or in program contexts. Indicators for the following aspects of complementary feeding of 6-23-month-old children are discussed: (1) breastfeeding; (2) energy from complementary foods; (3) nutrient density of complementary foods; and (4) safe preparation and storage of complementary foods. Finally, possible approaches to validate the proposed indicators are discussed and research priorities are highlighted.",Open Access,,"Ruel, Marie T.

Recognizing that mothe'rs work status may depend on the availability of childcare, decisions to participate in the labor force and to use formal day care are modeled to allow for the possibility that they may be jointly determined. We then explore the impact of childcare prices on mothers' earnings, conditional on her decision to work. Also explored is whether a mother's ""status"" within her household (as measured by the value of the assets she brought to her marriage) influences her entry into the labor force.....Our results indicate that participation in the labor market and use of formal day care are, in fact, joint decisions for mothers. Life cycle and household demographic factors have important effects on both decisions. Maternal education is an important determinant of utilization of formal day care, but does not have large effects on whether she works for pay or not.

1156,"This paper explores the global prevalence of an emerging phenomenon: the coexistence of a stunted child and an overweight mother in the same household. It also tests whether this phenomenon is associated with a country's level of economic development and urbanization. Policy directions for public nutrition are highlighted.  Data from 36 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) were used (23 in Africa, 8 in Latin America, and 5 in Asia). Stunting was defined as height-for-age < - 2 SD of the reference population and maternal overweight as a body mass index (BMI) of > 25 kg/m 2 . World Bank and United Nations figures were used for GNP per capita (our indicator of economic development) and for level of urbanization, respectively. Descriptive statistics were derived, and regression analysis was used to model the association between economic development, urbanization, and the prevalence of stunted children and overweight women (SCOWT). The prevalence of SCOWT is generally below 10 percent, except in four countries, of which three are in Latin America. Among our sample of countries, SCOWT is generally more prevalent in Latin America than in Africa, and is below 5 percent in all five Asian countries. Contrary to our expectations, SCOWT is not necessarily more prevalent in urban than rural areas. In fact, when economic development is controlled for, SCOWT is associated with urbanization only in Latin America. In Africa and Asia, SCOWT is associated with economic development, but not urbanization, which suggests that SCOWT may emerge only at levels of economic development and urbanization higher than currently seen in most of the Asian and African countries studied.",Open Access,,"Garrett, James L.

These inequality estimates are decomposed into progressively more disaggregated spatial units and the results in all three countries are suggestive that even at a very high level of spatial disaggregation, the contribution of within-community inequality to overall inequality remains very high.  The results also indicate there is a considerable amount of variation across communities in all three countries.  The basic correlates of local-level inequality are explored, and it is consistently found that geographic characteristics are strongly correlated with inequality, even after controlling for demographic and economic conditions."""" -- Authors' Abstract",Open Access,,"Elbers, Chris

Unlike previous studies on childcare that take mother's work status as given, this paper treats childcare choice and labor force participation of women as joint decisions. Our empirical results indicate that participation in the labor market and use of formal day care are, in fact, jointly determined. In both Guatemala and Accra, life cycle and household demographic factors, notably child age, appear to have important effects on both decisions. In both cities, higher household wealth reduces the mothers' chances of working, presumably via an income effect. Controlling for endogeneity of labor market participation and formal day-care use, in Guatemala, day-care prices do not have significant impacts on earnings; neither does the number of day-care centers within a 10-minute walk affect earnings in Accra. In Guatemala, maternal education is an important determinant of utilization of formal day care, but does not have large effects on whether she works for pay or not. In contrast, in Accra, maternal education does not affect either the demand for formal care or the decision to work. In Guatemala, greater travel time from home to the day-care center reduces utilization of this type of care, but a larger supply of day-care centers in the community does not affect use of formal care in Accra. The lack of importance of formal day-care supply variables in Accra -- compared to the effect of some variables such as travel time to day-care centers in Guatemala -- suggests that provision of formal day care may not be as critical an intervention to increase mothers' labor force participation rates in cities where the informal sector dominates, such as in Accra. In more urbanized settings like Guatemala City, where the formal sector generates a higher proportion of jobs for women, formal day care is more important to mothers' decision to work.",Open Access,,"Quisumbing, Agnes R.

1162,"Whose responsibility is it to assure food security in an age of globalization? Is improved governance at the international level our greatest need, or are governance deficits most severe at the national level? When national governments lag in assuring food security for their own citizens, can outsiders help make up the resulting governance deficit? What role can bilateral donors and international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, play? Is it possible for NGOs to step in to do the job? These and related pressing questions are addressed in this discussion paper by Robert Paarlberg. He argues that the problems of hunger and food insecurity urgently require a national, not global focus. Many national governments in developing countries still do  not provide essential public goods, such as civil peace, rule of law, transport infrastructure, clean water, electrical power, and public research to generate new agricultural productivity — essential ingredients in the effort to boost incomes. For tackling hunger, the weak per-formance of nation-states remains most critical—and in most critical need of improvement. According to Paarlberg, the governance challenge as far as food security is concerned is to persuade sovereign governments to provide the necessary public goods that would ensure access to adequate food. This paper was commissioned for IFPRI’s 2020 Vision Initiative conference, “Sustainable Food Security for All by 2020,” held on September 4–6, 2001, in Bonn, Germany. A summary   version was presented at the session on “Whose Responsibility Is It To End Hunger?”  The presentation sparked a long overdue discussion on who are the key actors in the effort to eliminate hunger, how their role has changed over time, and what their responsibilities are likely to be in the future.

1165,"""In contrast to popular predictions of Africa’s worsening economic decline, recent research supports an alternative and more positive vision of Africa’s future. New political commitment and African ownership of the development agenda, combined with a renewed focus on and investments in smallholder-led agriculture, have the potential to halt or reverse the current downward spiral of hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, disease, and civil strife. Building on lessons learned from past policy and implementation mistakes, this policy brief argues that now is the time to address key pillars of growth to revitalize the agriculture sector.... [This brief is based on an IFPRI technical paper in support of USAID’s Agricultural Initiative to Cut Hunger in Africa (AICHA),] in which investments to support agricultural growth are planned for three subregions: East,West, and Southern  Africa. Each regional action plan will link to and harmonize with national action plans in selected high-potential countries that are also expected to serve as nodes of agriculture-led growth within their subregions. All action plans will describe the process by which investment priorities and related analytical agendas will be developed, fine-tuned, and acted upon. USAID describes the action plans as documents that will include a 15-year vision of the initiative, specific programmatic thrusts for a five-year planning cycle, and annual work plans and targeted outputs. They are expected to be “rolling” planning documents that will also provide monitoring and evaluation information in accordance with a results framework established in the first action plan. Each plan will assess the likely impacts of the proposed investments on (1) overall economic and agricultural growth, (2) agricultural trade, (3) intraregional trade, (4) spillover effects through intraregional linkages in commodity and factor markets, and (5) regional growth, development, and hunger and poverty reduction.""-- taken from Brief",Open Access,,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,64649.cpd,64648,,,,,,2023-08-16,2023-08-16,,,,,"IFPRI1

1166,"This brief discusses a new breed of ultra-nourishing crops capable of alleviating malnutrition in even the most hard-to-reach populations—crops such as rice loaded with iron, maize packed with zinc, and wheat strengthened with vitamin A. These staples would need no commercial fortification, and could be grown on family plots throughout the developing world. It is now possible to breed plants for increased vitamin and mineral content, making “biofortified™” crops one of the most promising new tools in the fight to end malnutrition and save lives. The authors conclude that biofortification makes sense as part of an integrated food systems approach to reducing malnutrition. It addresses the root causes of micronutrient malnutrition, targets the poorest people, uses built-in delivery mechanisms, is scientifically feasible and cost-effective, and complements other on-going  methods of dealing with micronutrient deficiencies.",Open Access,,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,65048.cpd,65047,,,,,,2022-08-05,2022-08-05,,,,,IFPRI2,FCND,,,,,,English,,861351055,,Non-PR,4 pages,"Washington, DC

Will available freshwater meet the rapidly growing demands for household, industrial, and environmental needs and still provide enough water to produce food for a burgeoning population?

1182,"South African households live in an environment characterized by risks, and many face a significant probability of experiencing economic losses that threaten their daily subsistence. Using household panel data that include directly solicited information on economic shocks and employing household fixed-effects estimation, we explore how well households cope with shocks by examining the effects of shocks on child nutritional status. Unlike in the idealized village community, some households appear unable to insure against risk, particularly when others in their communities simultaneously suffer large losses. Households in communities with more social capital, however, seem better able to weather shocks.",Open Access,,"Carter, Michael R.

1183,"The calorie-income demand elasticity is an important parameter in the development literature and in the policy arena. Yet, there is very little evidence on the extent to which it can be considered as an unchanging parameter or a time-shifting parameter that, for example, changes with the economic conditions faced by households. In this paper I use data from the 1996 and 1999 National Socio-Economic Surveys (SUSENAS) in Indonesia to examine whether the relationship between income changes and caloric availability has changed and if so, how. Using the same questionnaire, the SUSENAS surveys collect detailed information on more than 200 different food items consumed over the last seven days by 60,000 households at the same point in each survey year. I use nonparametric as well as regression methods to examine two important relationships: (1) between income and total calories, and (2) between income and calories from cereals and other foods (excluding cereals and root crops). The empirical analysis finds that the income elasticity of the demand for total calories is slightly higher in February 1999 (the crisis year with dramatically different relative prices) compared to its level in February 1996. Also, the calorie-income elasticity for cereals as a group increases while the calorie-income elasticity for other food items decreases. The latter finding is interpreted as consistent with the presence of a binding subsistence constraint.",Open Access,,"Skoufias, Emmanuel",,43419.pdf,47961,,,,,,2011-07-14,2015-02-18,,,,,IFPRI1,FCND,,http://www.ifpri.org/pubs/misc/dt258.asp,,,FCND DP141,English,,778454078,,Non-PR,2 pages,"Washington, D.C.",,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,Brief,Discussion paper http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/62438,mailto:ifpri-library@cgiar.org,,FCND Discussion Paper Brief,141,,,"INDONESIA

1184,"Feeding practices are an important determinant of the nutritional status of infants and children. It is therefore useful to measure and describe infant and child feeding practices in a number of contexts. Such measurements could enable (1) international comparisons of the adequacy of infant and child feeding, (2) research linking infant and child feeding to determinants or outcomes, (3) advocacy regarding the importance of adequate infant and child feeding, and (4) monitoring and evaluation of interventions designed to change practices. This paper reports on progress in developing a summary measure of infant and child feeding practices—the infant and child feeding index (ICFI). The report also addresses two challenges in measuring child feeding practices, namely that infant and child feeding is multi-dimensional, and appropriate practices vary by age of the child. The authors refine the ICFI and confirm earlier findings that the ICFI is associated with child nutritional status. They also determine which components of the feeding index appear to be most important in driving its association with child nutritional status. Finally, they assess the potential usefulness of the index for the four purposes listed above.""""---from Authors' Abstract",Open Access,,"Arimond, Mary

1185,"Child labor is widespread in developing countries, but its causes are debatable. Poverty is considered the primary reason, but many theoretical and empirical analyses show that other factors, such as lack of access to credit, poor school quality, and labor market opportunities play equal or even greater roles in the decision to have children work. This study surveys the existing literature and, taking into account urban-rural divides, aims to shed light on the debate with empirical evidence from Nepal, Peru, and Zimbabwe. We find that while poverty drives child work and schooling in rural areas, it does not appear to significantly influence such decisions in urban areas. This suggests that policies such as trade sanctions or a ban on child labor in rural areas could have an adverse effect as child labor decisions in such areas are more likely a response to poverty and subsistence requirements. Similarly, improving access to credit has greater potential for alleviating child labor and enhancing school enrollment in rural than urban areas, particularly in Nepal and Zimbabwe. On the other hand, the availability of alternative childcare options appears to considerably decrease child labor and create conditions for higher school attendance rates in urban than in rural areas. Finally, evidence from all three countries indicates that efforts to bolster adult educational levels and wages will help curb the prevalence and intensity of child labor and improve the likelihood that children stay in school.

The results indicate that the required changes in direct and indirect tax rates needed to finance the grant without increasing the government deficit are substantially higher than currently predicted.... .

1187,"The Government of Bangladesh launched the innovative Food for Education (FFE) program in 1993. The FFE program provides a free monthly ration of rice or wheat to poor families if their children attend primary school. The goals of this program are to increase primary school enrollment, promote attendance, reduce dropout rates, and enhance the quality of education. This paper presents the findings of a recent International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) evaluation of the FFE program that demonstrates the extent to which these goals were met. This evaluation uses primary data collected from multiple surveys covering schools, households, communities, and foodgrain dealers. The authors first examine the performance of the FFE program, showing that it has largely fulfilled its objectives of   increasing school enrollment, promoting school attendance, and preventing dropouts. The enrollment increase was greater for girls than for boys. The quality of education, however, remains a problem. Next, they analyze the targeting effectiveness of the program, its impact on food security, and its efficiency in distributing rations. In general, the FFE program targets low-income households. However, there is considerable scope for improving targeting, as a sizable number of poor households remain excluded from the program even while many nonpoor households are included. Furthermore, the evaluation results indicate that the functioning of the current private-dealer-based`   foodgrain distribution system of the FFE program is not satisfactory.",Open Access,,"Ahmed, Akhter U.

Per capita consumption decreased for the households during this time and, while not dramatic, it occurred at all points along the distribution. Over the two-year period, the number of households that fell into poverty was over twice as large as the number of households that climbed out of poverty. About two-thirds of overall poverty was chronic (average consumption over time was below the poverty line), and almost half of all poor were always poor. We use quantile regression methods to identify the factors that explain total, chronic, and transitory poverty. While our analysis ably documents the extent of transitory poverty, it does not explain well the determinants of this type of poverty. The predominantly chronic nature of poverty in the sample, and our ability to identify associated characteristics, strengthens the case for targeting antipoverty interventions such as food subsidies.",Open Access,,"Haddad, Lawrence James

1189,"Despite achieving a significant cost reduction over the past two decades, the absolute cost of food subsidies in Egypt is still high relative to the benefits received by the poor. There is scope for better targeting food subsidies, in particular those for rationed cooking oil and sugar, both because reforms in this area are perceived to be far less politically sensitive than adjusting subsidy policies for bread and wheat flour and because higher income groups presently receive a significant percentage of the benefits. Targeting the high-subsidy green ration cards to the poor and the low-subsidy red ration cards to the nonpoor will require identification of both poor and nonpoor households. An    International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) research team in Egypt, in collaboration with the Egyptian Ministry of Trade and Supply, developed a proxy means test for targeting ration cards. This paper describes the process of moving from the optimal income-predicting model to the final model that was both administratively and politically feasible. An ex-ante evaluation of the levels of accuracy of the proxy means testing model indicates that the model performs quite well in predicting the needy and nonneedy households. An effective and full implementation of this targeting method would increase the equity in the ration card food subsidy system and, at the same time, lower the total budgetary costs of rationed food subsidies. Moreover, the experience gained under this reform would facilitate targeting future social interventions to reduce and prevent poverty in Egypt.",Open Access,,"Ahmed, Akhter U.

Reliable and affordable childcare alternatives are thus becoming increasingly important in urban areas. The Hogares Comunitarios Program (HCP), established in Guatemala City in 1991, was a direct response to the increasing need of poor urban dwellers for substitute childcare. This government-sponsored pilot program was designed as a strategy to alleviate poverty by providing working parents with low-cost, quality childcare within their community. This paper presents preliminary findings from an evaluation of the HCP carried out in 1998 in urban slums of Guatemala City. The evaluation included both an operations (or process) evaluation and an impact evaluation. Key findings of the    operations evaluation are summarized, and preliminary findings of the impact evaluation on children’s dietary intakes are presented. Aspects related to the targeting, coverage, and cost of the program are also discussed, and the patterns of childcare use by nonbeneficiary households and their costs are described.",Open Access,,"Ruel, Marie T.

1193,"As the goals of international agricultural research move beyond increasing food production to the broader aims of reducing poverty, both agricultural research and studies of its impact become more complex. Yet examining the magnitude and mechanisms through which different types of agricultural research are able to help the poor is essential, not only to evaluate claims for continued funding of such research, but more importantly, to guide future research in ways that will make the greatest contribution to poverty reduction. This paper reports on the approach used in a multicountry study of the poverty impact of research programs under the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). The studies use an expanded understanding of poverty that goes beyond income-or consumption-based headcounts or severity measures, to consider many other factors that poor people in different contexts define as contributing to their vulnerability, poverty, and well-being. The sustainable livelihoods framework provides a common conceptual approach to examining the ways in which agricultural research and technologies fit (or sometimes do not fit) into the livelihood strategies of households or individuals with different types of assets and other resources, strategies that often involve multiple activities undertaken at different times of the year. This paper reports on the conceptual framework, methods, and findings to date of these studies. It provides an overview of the sustainable livelihoods approach, how it can be applied to agricultural research, and describes detailed methods and results from five case studies: (1) modern rice varieties in Bangladesh; (2) polyculture fishponds   and vegetable gardens in Bangladesh; (3) soil fertility management practices in Kenya; (4) hybrid maize in Zimbabwe; and (5) creolized maize varieties in Mexico.",Open Access,,"Adato, Michelle

Specifically, the authors examine (1) the importance of trust in the decision to join groups, (2) the subsequent ability of groups to generate trust, and (3) the influence of group membership and trust on a measure of well-being, per capita household income. They use longitudinal data from KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, allowing them to control for potential simultaneity and measurement-error problems in the estimation. They disaggregate groups into financial and nonfinancial and “trust in people” by type of agent or actor. They can thus examine whether different types of trust are important for participating in different types of groups and whether different types of group participation are important for generating different types of trust. The research finds that (1) trust in local agents is an important determinant of membership in financial groups but not for membership in nonfinancial groups, (2) membership in both types of groups generates trust in nonlocal agents but not local agents, and (3) membership in financial and nonfinancial groups leads to higher well-being. The first two results suggest that financial groups serve a role in expanding the radius of trust, while the first and third results suggest a role for trust in improving well-being.",Open Access,,"Haddad, Lawrence James

In addition, data on the undernutrition rates since the 1970s available from a cross-section of countries are employed in this investigation. Both forms of analysis yield similar results. Income increases at household and national levels imply similar rates of reduction in undernutrition. Using these estimates and better-than-historical income growth rates, we find that the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the levels of child underweight by 2015 is unlikely to be met through income growth alone. What is needed is a balanced strategy of income growth and investment in more direct interventions to accelerate reductions in undernutrition.",Open Access,,"Haddad, Lawrence James

1197,"Household food security is an important measure of well-being. Although it may not encapsulate all dimensions of poverty, the inability of households to obtain access to enough food for an active, healthy life is surely an important component of their poverty. Accordingly, devising an appropriate measure of food security outcomes is useful in order to identify the food insecure, assess the severity of their food shortfall, characterize the nature of their insecurity (for example, seasonal versus chronic), predict who is most at risk of future hunger, monitor changes in circumstances, and assess the impact of   interventions. However, obtaining detailed data on food security status—such as 24- hour recall data on caloric intakes—can be time consuming and expensive and require a high level of technical skill both in data collection and analysis. This paper examines whether an alternative indicator, dietary diversity, defined as the number of unique foods consumed over a given period of time, provides information on household food security. It draws on data from 10 countries (India, the Philippines, Mozambique, Mexico, Bangladesh, Egypt, Mali, Malawi, Ghana, and Kenya) that encompass both poor and middle-income countries, rural and urban sectors, data collected in different seasons, and data on calories acquisition obtained using two different methods. ....[D]ietary diversity would appear to show promise as a means of measuring food security and monitoring changes and impact, particularly when resources available for such measurement are scarce.",Open Access,,"Hoddinott, John F.

1198,"Despite rapid economic growth in recent years, Mozambique remains a very poor country. Expenditure-based poverty measures are reflected in widespread food insecurity and poor health status. In recognition of these problems, the Government of Mozambique is promoting expanded and improved quality and equity in access to health care as an important component in the global strategy to fight poverty. Given years of colonial neglect and systematic destruction of health facilities during the civil war, recent government policy has focused on expanding the rural health network. However, insofar as the ultimate objective of the provision of curative services is to ensure that those in need of care receive effective treatment, it is also necessary to think beyond supply. Specifically, we need to consider how individuals behave during episodes of illness, and what factors affect this behavior. This paper provides quantitative evidence on the importance of individual, household, and community characteristics on individuals’ care-seeking decisions during episodes of illness. The paper estimates a “flexible” multinomial model of health care provider choice conditional on illness using data from the 1996/97 Mozambique National Household Survey on Living Conditions (IAF). The empirical analysis is underpinned by a basic theoretical framework of utility maximization and household production of health. A number of individual and household characteristics, e.g., age, education, and reported symptoms, stand out as highly significant determinants of health seeking behavior. Also, prices, defined in the model as the composite of user fees and time costs associated with consultations at different providers, are found to be important determinants of choice. The results indicate that the eradication of poverty, independent of improvements in physical access to health care and education, will have only a negligible effect on health care choices.",Open Access,,"Lindelow, Magnus",,43435.pdf,47977,,,,,,2011-07-14,2022-10-26,,,,,IFPRI1,FCND,,http://www.ifpri.org/pubs/misc/dt280.asp,,,,English,,778454228,,Non-PR,2 pages,"Washington, DC",,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,Brief,Discussion paper http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/48965,mailto:ifpri-library@cgiar.org,,FCND Discussion Paper Brief,126,,,"MOZAMBIQUE

They find that whereas the undercoverage and leakage welfare indices always suggest substantial losses, and the poverty indices suggest substantial losses for the worst  performing indices, their preferred welfare index based on standard welfare theory suggests much smaller welfare losses. They also find that one cannot reject the hypothesis that the welfare losses associated with using the better performing alternative indicators are zero. In the case of their preferred welfare index, this reflects the fact that most of the targeting errors, i.e., exclusion and inclusion errors, are highly concentrated around the poverty line so that the differences in welfare weights between those receiving and not receiving the transfers are insufficient to make a difference to the overall welfare impact.",Open Access,,"Skoufias, Emmanuel

We consider two alternatives: (1) extensive expansion of the school system (i.e., bringing  education to the poor) and (2) subsidizing investment in education by the poor (i.e., bringing the poor to the education system). To this end, we evaluate the Programa Nacional de Educación, Salud y Alimentación (PROGRESA), a large poverty alleviation program recently introduced in Mexico that subsidizes education. Using double-difference regression estimators on data collected before and after the program for randomly selected control and treatment households, we estimate the relative impacts of the demand- and supply-side program components. Combining these estimates with cost information, we find that the demand-side subsidies are substantially more cost-effective than supply-side expansions.",Open Access,,"Coady, David

1202,"During the last half century, a number of individuals and institutions, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and IFPRI, have engaged in projections of future food demand, supply, and related variables. In this brief, Alex McCalla and Cesar Revoredo compare projections with real-life outcomes. Projections forecast outcomes on the basis of certain underlying factors. If such forecasted outcomes are undesirable, changes may be made in the underlying factors so that the projections may not, in fact, come to pass. Many projections serve this precise goal. Therefore, the success of projections may not be that they match actual outcomes but that they avoid such outcomes by promoting action to change underlying variables. Unlike predictions, which are successful only if they match actual outcomes, projections that differ from actual outcomes may reflect either poor projection models or changes in underlying variables, possibly caused by the projections themselves.",Open Access,,"McCalla, Alex F.

1208,"The primary goal of agricultural research has been to increase  agricultural production, particularly in high-potential areas. This has contributed enormously to reducing the number of people living in poverty worldwide, as well as to reducing food prices for all. Despite these gains, about 1 billion rural people still live in poverty in the developing world. In an era in which global food supplies are plentiful though poorly distributed and trade barriers are being reduced, the public sector has a greater opportunity to focus more resources on research strategies that directly benefit the poor. This opportunity is enhanced by the private sector’s increasing role in addressing many mainstream productivity challenges at the global level. But what strategies should the public sector adopt if it is to more explicitly address the needs of the poor? Six key topics for pro-poor agricultural research agendas are described by the authors.",Open Access,,"Hazell, Peter B. R.

1209,"Developing Asia as a whole has taken remarkable strides since the food crises of the 1960s. Improvements in food security, poverty reduction, and per capita income initiated by the Green Revolution have been substantial and lasting. Although life has improved for most rural Asians, about 670 million still live in poverty, and they must tolerate lower levels of health, education, and general well-being than their urban counterparts. To complete the economic transformation in rural Asia requires further growth, but growth that is more equitable and environmentally sustainable than it has been in the past. Meeting this challenge will warrant more efficient application of the lessons already learned about agricultural growth, public-sector investment, rural poverty reduction, and natural resource protection. The authors argue that six emerging challenges will also need special attention: (1) Making growth pro-poor; (2)  Managing the legacy of the economic crisis; (3) Managing globalization; (4) Revitalizing agricultural research and technology dissemination; (5) Managing land and water scarcity and degradation; and (6) Building good governance and social capital.",Open Access,,"Rosegrant, Mark W.

1214,"Cash transfer programs induce multiplier effects when recipients put the money they receive to work to generate additional income. The ultimate income effects are multiples of the amounts transferred. This paper analyzes the PROCAMPO program in Mexico, which was introduced to compensate farmers for the anticipated negative effect of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on the price of basic crops. The transfer rules and the timing of the panel data collected allow unique control of biases in this impact analysis. We find that the multiplier among ejido sector recipients is in the range of 1.5 to 2.6. Multipliers are higher for medium and large farm households, low numbers of adults in the household, nonindigenous backgrounds, and households located in the Center and Gulf regions. High multipliers reflect marginal income opportunities that were unrealized due to liquidity constraints that the transfers eased. Opportunities came from the asset endowments that these households have, particularly irrigated land, and these opportunities were enhanced by access to technical assistance.",Open Access,,"Sadoulet, Elisabeth

This paper examines the targeting performance of seven programs in Western Cape Province, and analyzes the role of government, community-based organizations, trade unions, and the  private sector in explaining targeting outcomes. These programs were not well-targeted geographically in terms of poverty, unemployment, or infrastructure. Within localities, jobs went to the poor and unemployed, though not always the poorest. They did well in reaching women, despite local gender bias.

PROGRESA is a new program of the Mexican government aimed at alleviating extreme poverty in rural areas. It combats the different causes of poverty by providing cash benefits that are targeted directly to households on the condition of children attending school and visiting health clinics on a regular basis. Some of the questions addressed are as follows: Does the program reduce child labor? Does it increase participation in school activities? Does the latter occur at the expense of children's leisure time? And how do the effects of the program vary by age group and gender? Our empirical analysis relies on data from a quasi-experimental design used to evaluate the impact of the program involving a sample of communities that receive PROGRESA benefits (treatment) and comparable communities that receive benefits at a later time (control). We estimate the effect of “treatment on the treated” using both double-difference and cross sectional difference estimators. Our estimates show significant increases in the school attendance of boys and girls that are accompanied by significant reductions in the participation of boys and girls in work activities. We also find that the program has a lower impact on the incidence of work for girls relative to boys.",Open Access,,"Skoufias, Emmanuel

In 1999, an International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) team on microfinance conducted a survey on MFIs in Asia, Africa, and Latin America in order to offer a new in-depth analysis on the distribution and performances of MFIs at the international level. A systematic sampling has been adopted through the contacting of international NGOs and networks supporting various MFIs. The information has been complemented by a review of publications and technical manuals on microfinance. The database of MFIs from 85 developing countries shows 1,500 institutions (790 institutions worldwide plus 688 in Indonesia) supported by international organizations. They reach 54 million members, 44 million savers (voluntary and compulsory savings), and 23 million borrowers. The total volume of outstanding credit is $18 billion. The total savings volume is $12 billion, or 72 percent of the volume of the outstanding loans. MFIs have developed at least 46,000 branches and employ around 175,000 staff. The IFPRI database underlines the presence of a multitude of MFIs that, except in unstable countries, are widespread, with no forgotten regions. MFIs are very diverse in terms of lending technologies and legal status, which allows room for innovation, but they remain highly concentrated. The data are analyzed by type of MFIs and by geographic regions. The results presented give an overview of the current development of MFIs and offer a benchmark for comparisons.",Open Access,,"Lapenu, Cecile

Transfers are also conditioned on household members attending school and health clinics. We show that the program has a relatively high distributional power compared to a range of alternatives considered. Although geographic targeting has a relatively large effect on the distributional power of the program, the demographic structure of transfers is more important than household targeting. However, the gains from household targeting increase as the program expands into less marginal localities. Within the structure of transfers, the education component is distributionally more powerful than the food component, reflecting the fact that the former is based on household demographics, while the latter is uniform across households. Restructuring education grants towards secondary schooling in order to generate higher education impacts does not appear to affect the distributional power of the program. In any case, any adverse impact could be offset by increasing the cap on transfers, which is regressive. Take-up of the program is high but relatively higher among the poorest households, thus increasing distributional power. However, this effect is mitigated by the fact that, conditional on program take-up, the poorest households take up a relatively lower proportion of potential transfers.",Open Access,,"Coady, David",,43445.pdf,47987,,,,,,2011-07-14,2022-11-01,,,,,IFPRI1,FCND,,http://www.ifpri.org/pubs/misc/dt28e.asp,,,,English,,778454785,,Non-PR,2 pages,"Washington, DC",,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,Brief,Discussion paper http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/75223,mailto:ifpri-library@cgiar.org,,FCND Discussion paper brief,117,,,"MEXICO

1268,"The nutritional transition currently occurring in Asia is one facet of a more general demographic/nutritional/epidemiological transition that accompanies development and urbanization, marked by a shift away from relatively monotonous diets of varying nutritional quality toward an industrialized diet that is usually more varied, includes more preprocessed food, more food of animal origin, more added sugar and fat, and often more alcohol. This is accompanied by shift in the structure of occupations and leisure toward reduced physical activity, and leads to a rapid increase in the numbers of overweight and obese. The accompanying epidemiological transition is marked by a shift away from endemic deficiency and infectious diseases toward chronic diseases such as obesity, adult-onset diabetes, hypertension, stroke, hyperlipidaemia, coronary heart disease, and cancer. Obesity is now a major public health problem in Asia. Obesity is a problem of the urban poor as well as the rich, and the urban poor have the added predisposing factors associated with low birthweight. Costs of chronic disease are estimated for China and Sri Lanka. Diet-related chronic disease is projected to increase and dietary factors (principally overweight) will account for an increased share of chronic disease, and childhood factors will decline in significance. Few program and policy options to address these issues have been undertaken in Asia. Agricultural policy is important, and the relatively cheap availability of vegetable oil may have had dramatic (adverse) dietary effects in Asia. Price policy has considerable potential, in particular the pricing of oils. Promoting a traditional diet has been quite helpful in holding down fat intake and obesity in Korea. Health promotion efforts in Mauritius succeeded in reversing several adverse trends contributing to coronary heart disease. Thailand has successfully used mass media for other health promotion efforts and is moving to pilot schemes in the area of chronic disease. And Singapore has been the leader in the region in exercise promotion and weight control in schools.",Open Access,,"Popkin, Barry M.

PROGRESA provides poor mothers in poor rural communities with education grants, if their children attend school regularly. Enrollment rates are compared between groups of poor children who reside in communities randomly selected to participate in the initial phase of the PROGRESA program and those who reside in other comparably poor (control) communities. Pre-program comparisons document how well the randomized design is implemented, and double-differenced estimators are reported over time within this panel of children. Probit models are then estimated for the probability that an individual child is enrolled, which statistically controls for additional characteristics of the child, their parents, local schools, and community, and for samples of different compositions, to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated program effects to these variations. If the current relationship of the program outlays to enrollments, and that of schooling to increased adult earnings, both persist in the future, the internal rate of return to the PROGRESA educational grants as an investment is estimated to be about 8 percent, which accrues in addition to the program’s efficacy as a poverty reduction program.",Open Access,,"Schultz, T.

Yet, existing methods for evaluating their outreach are generally unsuited to most operational settings, since they are either too costly and cumbersome (e.g., detailed income or household surveys), or they produce results that are not comparable between villages or regions within a country (e.g., participatory poverty appraisals). This paper presents a new and operationally suitable method to measure the poverty of clients of development projects in relation to the general population of  nonclients. The method was developed in response to demands by donors and development practitioners for a low-cost evaluation instrument that could be used as a regular operational tool for assessing the poverty outreach of a development project or institution. While the method was originally developed for the purpose of assessing the poverty outreach of microfinance institutions (MFIs), we believe the method can be used   for any development policy or project that pursues an explicit objective of reaching poorer people. The paper begins by discussing existing methods of poverty assessment. Next, the paper presents heuristic steps for identifying indicators of poverty to be tested in the case studies, including the questionnaire that was field tested in four countries with large differences in poverty-level, socioeconomic, and cultural contexts, and with MFIs that worked either in urban, rural, or mixed areas with different target clientele and financial products. The authors then describe the method of principal component analysis used to construct a poverty score as the measure of relative poverty. The paper concludes with a summary of results from four country case studies (two in Sub-Saharan Africa, one in South Asia, and one in Central America).",Open Access,,"Zeller, Manfred

Millions have died and livelihoods have been devastated, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Agriculture and natural resources are important components of such livelihoods. And the nutritional status of those infected and affected plays a large part in determining their current welfare and their ability to further develop their livelihoods towards activities that help to mitigate the impacts of AIDS and prevent the spread of HIV. This paper first reviews the potential pathways through which HIV/AIDS affects assets and institutions generally and then the specific impacts on agriculture, natural resource management, food security, and nutrition. The review addresses the question of how the public sector can and should respond to these challenges. The focus is primarily on mitigation, though the authors note that effective mitigation can also serve as a very cost-effective form of prevention. As labor becomes depleted, new cultivation technologies and varieties need to be developed that do not rely so much on labor, yet allow crops to remain drought resistant and nutritious.",Open Access,,"Haddad, Lawrence James

1275,"Using data from fieldwork conducted in Nepal, the impact of a project designed to commercialize vegetables and fruits — the Vegetable and Fruit Cash Crop Program (VFC)— on male and female time allocation is examined. Using a rigorous time collection methodology, activity patterns in households that adopt and do not adopt the new technology are profiled. Very few studies examine changing activity patterns of both men and women in response to commercialization of agriculture. Though women’s time is valuable in agriculture, it is also valuable in the production of child nutrition. The recent evolution in thinking as to the causes of child malnutrition—the three pillars being food intake, health, and time to care—warrants further analyses of the time trade-offs that women and men face when adopting new agricultural technologies. The VFC program was successful at targeting both men and women farmers in the sense that household participation resulted in increased head male and head female time spent growing vegetables and fruits. The responses varied, however, by the number of preschool children in residence. In households with more than one preschooler, the time trade-offs associated with VFC participation were not sizeable for the care of children under 5 years. In households with just one preschooler, the trade-offs were more important. In these households, preschoolers received less care from the male and female heads, who spent more time in both the cash crop and in the food crop. In these same households, the nonwork (leisure) time of men increased as a result of VFC participation, but for women, leisure time was unaffected. Thus in the short run, there is perhaps scope for protecting childcare time by reducing time to leisure. In the medium run, benefits may well accrue to unborn preschoolers if VFC participation empowers women.",Open Access,,"Paolisso, Michael J.

Following a brief review of the various rationales for an intensified focus on capacity and capacity development, the paper examines the linkages between nutrition programming and capacity development processes before proposing a new approach to assessing, analyzing, and developing capacity. The ensuing sections then focus in more detail on the ingredients and influences of capacity at the levels of the community, program management, supporting institutions, and the government. Finally, the implications of a more proactive focus on strengthening nutrition capacity for donor modes of operation and support priorities are discussed.",Open Access,,"Gillespie, Stuart",,43452.pdf,47994,,,,,,2011-07-14,2022-11-22,,,,,"IFPRI1

Data from a representative survey of households with children less than 3 years of age in Accra were used to test a number of hypothesized constraints to child care, including various maternal (education, employment, marital status, age, health, ethnic group,   migration status) and household-level factors (income, calorie availability, quality of housing and asset ownership, availability of services, household size, and crowding). An age-specific child care index was created using recall data on maternal child feeding practices and use of preventive health services. A hygiene index was created from spot check observations of proxies of hygiene behaviors. Multivariate analyses showed that maternal schooling was the most consistent constraint to both the care and the hygiene index. None of the household-level characteristics were associated with the care index, but better housing quality and access to garbage collection services were associated with better hygiene. Female head of household and larger family size were associated with poorer hygiene. The programmatic implications of these findings for nutrition education and behavior change interventions in Accra are discussed. The focus is on using the information to target the right practices to be modified as well as the main constraints to their adoption.",Open Access,,"Armar-Klemesu, Margaret

If they survive childhood, many of these children will suffer from poorer cognitive development and lower productivity. As adults, their ability to assure good nutrition for their children could be compromised, perpetuating a vicious cycle. What will it take to eradicate child malnutrition in developing countries? As Lisa Smith and Lawrence Haddad point out in this 2020 Vision discussion paper, Overcoming Child Malnutrition in Developing Countries: Past Achievements and Future Choices, we must first understand the causes of malnutrition and delineate which are the most important before we can identify and act upon those areas of intervention that will be most successful in reducing malnutrition. Toward that end, their path-breaking research identifies and assesses the contribution of each key determinant to reductions in child malnutrition over the past quarter century. The most startling and important finding is that improvements in women’s education have contributed by far the most, accounting for 43 percent of the reduction in child malnutrition between 1970 and 1995, while improvements in per capita food availability con tributed about 26 percent. In a signal service to policymakers, Smith and Haddad also evaluate the potential of these factors to further reduce malnutrition durng the next two decades to 2020 and lay out the key policy priorities for each major developing region. By shedding light on which areas of intervention will be most successful in overcoming child malnutrition in developing countries, this research will contribute to realizing the 2020 Vision of a world where hunger and malnutrition are absent.""""

1281,"In a context of liberalized financial systems, microfinance allows millions of households, usually excluded from classical financial services, to begin or reinforce their own activities and become microentrepreneurs. Yet, in spite of the success of numerous microfinance institutions (MFI), many difficulties remain which must be urgently resolved in view of their ambitious objectives. First, a large number of the rural households still lack access to financial services. Second, most of the existing MFI are not yet financially sustainable. Finally, while funds from governments and donors are rapidly increasing, financial institutions still need solid foundations to avoid management failures. These issues raise questions of the role of the state to promote MFI including (1) which state-owned institutions may be necessary? (2) which level and type of subsidization of the financial institutions can be accepted? (3) what can be the choice for the state between alternative investments in financial institutions or complementary services? (4) what are the necessary conditions for creating a favorable environment? This paper presents the evolution of views on the role of the state in the financial system including theoretical and empirical points of view from the interventionist period of the 1960s and 1970s to the current period of liberalization. Based on country case studies illustrating the divergent role of the state in the development of the rural financial system, the paper reviews the respective role of the state, the NGO and the private commercial banks in increasing their outreach and in adopting microfinance innovations. It also analyzes different issues regarding regulation of MFI.",Open Access,,"Lapenu, Cecile",,43355.pdf,47897,,,,,,2011-07-14,2018-04-26,,,,ARCHIVAL MATERIAL DOES NOT CIRCULATE.,IFPRI1,FCND,,,,,FCND DP89,English,,861350507,,Non-PR,2 pages,"Washington, D.C.",,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,Brief,Discussion paper http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/125444,mailto:ifpri-library@cgiar.org,,FCND Discussion paper brief,89,,,,"small enterprises

However, in developing countries, where a significant part of the school age population never attends school, policymakers must consider both quality and quantity when deciding how to maximize the impact of scarce investments. Acknowledging this difference in the policy environment in developing countries, this paper provides comparative estimates of the impact of quality versus quantity investments in school supply in rural Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries. Policy simulations show that improving school quality (through the pupil-teacher ratio) increases grade attainment and efficiency by approximately 9 percent with no impact on overall enrollment rates. However, these same results can be generated by increasing starting enrollment probabilities through the establishment of new schools in all rural villages that currently do not have schools. Furthermore, similar rates of increase in school achievement indicators can be achieved by building schools in only 56 percent of all villages currently without schools, provided these schools are placed in those villages that also do not have a school nearby. When cost information is considered, the main policy implication is that the expansion of school quantity through well targeted placement of new schools will provide the greatest increase in educational outcomes for Mozambique at this time.",Open Access,,"Handa, Sudhanshu

The survey that was conducted in 1997 made extensive use of long-term recall questions ascertaining changes during the past 10 years in rice yields, wages, population, soil fertility, and other pertinent variables of rural development. We find that—on average for all villages—the yields of irrigated rice, the major food crop, and real agricultural wages declined, while the communities expanded their upland area by nearly a quarter and experienced deteriorating fertility of their upland soils. These patterns are consistent with the wide-held belief that rural areas in Madagascar have witnessed increased poverty,   economic stagnation, and a continued degradation of the natural resources. Yet, the five agroecological regions in our sample exhibit quite different patterns of rural development, and at least one of them has experienced increases in yields and wages. From a policy perspective, it is important to better understand the driving forces of such   diverse rural change. The overall decline in rural wages over the past 10 years is expected to have contributed to increased poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition in rural areas, as rural wage laborers traditionally belong to the poorest of the poor in Madagascar. In this   paper, we present an econometric analysis of the determinants of and interdependencies between the three components of sustainable development: economic growth, environmental sustainability, and poverty alleviation.",Open Access,,"Zeller, Manfred

Declining soil fertility and mismanagement of plant nutrients have made this task more difficult. In this brief, Peter Gruhn, Francesco Goletti, and Montague Yudelman point out that as long as agriculture remains a soil-based industry, major increases in productivity are unlikely to be attained without ensuring that plants have an adequate and balanced supply of nutrients. They call for an Integrated Nutrient Management approach to the management of plant nutrients for maintaining and enhancing soil, where both natural and man-made sources of plant nutrients are used. The key components of this approach are described; the roles and responsibilities of various actors, including farmers and institutions, are delineated; and recommendations for improving the management of plant nutrients and soil fertility are presented.",Open Access,,"Gruhn, Peter

The evidence so far is mixed. In some prominent countries such as China, policies are in place that encourage the independent development and planting of GM crops. Yet in a number of other equally prominent countries the planting of GM crops is not yet officially approved. The inclination of developing countries to promote or block the spread of GM crops can be judged by the policy choices they make in five separate areas: intellectual property rights (IPR) policy, biosafety policy, trade policy, food safety policy, and public research investments. Paarlberg discusses various policy options related to GM crops: (1) Intellectual Property Rights; (2) Biosafety; (3) Trade; (4) Food Safety and Consumer Choice; and (5) Public Research Investments.

Husbands and wives often use their bargaining power to express different priorities about how assets should be allocated. Understanding these differences and their effects is critical if policymakers are to improve livelihoods. Increasing the bargaining power of one gender group rather than another can mean the difference between policy failure and policy success. According to the study, a household survey covered 47 villages in three sites in Bangladesh, improving a woman’s bargaining power and access to resources will increase household expenditure on children’s education, but improving the same for a man generally will not. Increasing maternal control over household resources should improve the health of girl children. Given that women in Bangladesh face disadvantages with respect to both asset ownership and education, it is possible that the greatest impact of interventions that increase resources under women’s control will be felt by the next generation.",Open Access,,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,43299.pdf,47841,,,,,,2011-07-14,2015-02-21,,,,,"IFPRI1

It compares information obtained using participatory appraisal techniques with a survey of households randomly drawn from a locally administered census that had been carefully revised. The community map tends to include household members who do not, in fact, reside in the enumerated locality. By contrast, the revised official census is slightly more likely to exclude household members who actually lived in the surveyed area. Controlling for the survey technique, we find that the revised official census produces higher estimates of average household size and wealth but lower estimates of total village size or wealth, than the community map. Pairwise comparison of the survey techniques, holding the households constant, shows that the community map leads, on average, to higher estimates of household size and lower estimates of wealth.",Open Access,,"Christiaensen, Luc

1290,"Longitudinal household data can have considerable advantages over much more widely used cross-sectional data. The collection of longitudinal data, however, may be difficult and expensive. One problem that has concerned many analysts is that sample attrition may make the interpretation of estimates problematic. Such attrition may be particularly severe in areas where there is considerable mobility because of migration between rural and urban areas. Many analysts share the intuition that attrition is likely to be selective on characteristics such as schooling and that high attrition is likely to bias estimates made from longitudinal data. This paper considers the extent of and implications of attrition for three longitudinal household surveys from Bolivia, Kenya, and South Africa that report very high per-year attrition rates between survey rounds. Our estimates indicate that (1) the means for a number of critical outcome and family background variables differ significantly between attritors and nonattritors; (2) a number of family background variables are significant predictors of attrition; but (3) nevertheless, the coefficient estimates for “standard” family background variables in regressions and probit equations for the majority of the outcome variables considered in all three data sets are not affected significantly by attrition. Therefore, attrition apparently is not a general problem for obtaining consistent estimates of the coefficients of interest for most of these outcomes. These results, which are very similar to results for developed economies, suggest that for these outcome variables—despite suggestions of systematic attrition from univariate comparisons between attritors and nonattritors, multivariate estimates of behavioral relations of interest may not be biased due to attrition.",Open Access,,"Alderman, Harold

Unfortunately in attempting to answer these questions, little is known, under actual living conditions in rural areas, about the magnitude of the effects of various components of the diet in reducing IDA. Plant breeding holds great potential for providing a low-cost intervention that could help to improve iron status broadly for populations with a high prevalence of iron deficiency....Although cost-effective, plant breeding is only one of several interventions that are all required in tandem to reduce micronutrient malnutrition.",Open Access,,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,43295.pdf,47837,,,,,,2011-07-14,2022-09-10,,,,,"IFPRI1

1294,"The brief  states that the bargaining power of men and women crucially shapes the resource allocation decisions households make. Husbands and wives often use their bargaining power to express different priorities about how assets should be allocated. Understanding these differences and their effects is critical if policymakers are to improve livelihoods. Increasing the bargaining power of one gender group rather than another can mean the difference between policy failure and policy success. According to the study, a household survey covered 47 villages in three sites in Bangladesh, improving a woman’s bargaining power and access to resources will increase household expenditure on children’s education, but improving the same for a man generally will not. Increasing maternal control over household resources should improve the health of girl children. Given that women in Bangladesh face disadvantages with respect to both asset ownership and education, it is possible that the greatest impact of interventions that increase resources under women’s control will be felt by the next generation.",Open Access,,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,43299.pdf,47841,,,,,,2011-07-14,2015-02-21,,,,,"IFPRI1

1295,"The brief discusses the growing body of literature [that] suggests that men and women allocate resources under their control in systematically different ways. Studies have examined the effect of women’s income on household expenditure patterns and found that women typically spend a higher proportion of their income on food and health care for children, as well as other goods for general household consumption than do men. Other evidence from developing countries indicates that female income more often has a greater impact than male income on infant and child survival probabilities, preschooler nutrition, and child education. An issue related to intrahousehold allocation is that of gender bias. The brief concludes by stating that several policy implications of this study. First, increasing maternal control over household resources should improve the health of girl children.  Second, a higher degree of female command over household wealth may encourage parents in subsequent generations to invest more in daughters. Third, establishment of a formal social security system could reduce bias toward investing more in sons by decreasing elderly parents’ reliance on adult sons.",Open Access,,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,43296.pdf,47838,,,,,,2011-07-14,2022-08-05,,,,,"IFPRI1

Data from a representative survey of households with children less than 3 years of age in Accra were used to test a number of hypothesized constraints to child care, including various maternal (education, employment, marital status, age, health, ethnic group,   migration status) and household-level factors (income, calorie availability, quality of housing and asset ownership, availability of services, household size, and crowding). An age-specific child care index was created using recall data on maternal child feeding practices and use of preventive health services. A hygiene index was created from spot check observations of proxies of hygiene behaviors. Multivariate analyses showed that maternal schooling was the most consistent constraint to both the care and the hygiene index. None of the household-level characteristics were associated with the care index, but better housing quality and access to garbage collection services were associated with better hygiene. Female head of household and larger family size were associated with poorer hygiene. The programmatic implications of these findings for nutrition education and behavior change interventions in Accra are discussed.

1300,"Since the late 1970s dramatic economic changes have taken place in the agricultural sector in the highlands of Guatemala. The introduction of new export crops, such as snow peas, broccoli, and miniature vegetables, has led to yet another agro-export boom. Unlike earlier booms, however, this one has included all but the smallest farmers. The high rate of smallholder participation in the boom, and the initial high profitability of nontraditional exports (NTXs), fueled initial optimism that NTX production could increase smallholders’ ability to accumulate land and so decrease the highly skewed distribution of land in Guatemala, a country with one of the most unequal landholding patterns in all of Latin America. The picture that emerges from the analysis in this paper raises serious questions about the sustainability and equity effects of NTX crop adoption among smallholders in the long run. Two main findings illustrate the problems besetting NTX crop production. First, the land accumulation rates of adopters have dropped dramatically in the 1990s. NTX crop adopters accumulated close to three times more land than non-adopters in the 1980s. Although adopters are still accumulating more land than non-adopters in the 1990s, the gap between the two groups has narrowed substantially. Second, smaller adopters are no longer accumulating land at higher rates than their larger counterparts. In the 1980s the landholdings of smaller adopters grew significantly faster than those of the larger adopters, but this trend reversed itself in the1990s. The advantages smallholders initially had in accumulating land may have been lost as a result of deteriorating agronomic conditions and volatile export markets.",Open Access,,"Carletto, Calogero",,43365.pdf,47907,,,,,,2011-07-14,2022-11-18,,,,ARCHIVAL MATERIAL DOES NOT CIRCULATE.,IFPRI1,FCND,,http://www.ifpri.org/pubs/misc/dt2c1.asp,,,FCND DP80,English,,778454051,,Non-PR,2 pages,"Washington, DC",,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,Brief,Discussion paper http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/125411,mailto:ifpri-library@cgiar.org,,FCND discussion paper Brief,80,,,"GUATEMALA

1302,"In a context of liberalized financial systems, microfinance allows millions of households, usually excluded from classical financial services, to begin or reinforce their own activities and become microentrepreneurs. Yet, in spite of the success of numerous microfinance institutions (MFI), many difficulties remain which must be urgently resolved in view of their ambitious objectives. First, a large number of the rural households still lack access to financial services. Second, most of the existing MFI are not yet financially sustainable. Finally, while funds from governments and donors are rapidly increasing, financial institutions still need solid foundations to avoid management failures. These issues raise questions of the role of the state to promote MFI including (1) which state-owned institutions may be necessary? (2) which level and type of subsidization of the financial institutions can be accepted? (3) what can be the choice for the state between alternative investments in financial institutions or complementary services? (4) what are the necessary conditions for creating a favorable environment? This paper presents the evolution of views on the role of the state in the financial system including theoretical and empirical points of view from the interventionist period of the 1960s and 1970s to the current period of liberalization. Based on country case studies illustrating the divergent role of the state in the development of the rural financial system, the paper reviews the respective role of the state, the NGO and the private commercial banks in increasing their outreach and in adopting microfinance innovations. It also analyzes different issues regarding regulation of MFI.",Open Access,,"Lapenu, Cecile",,43355.pdf,47897,,,,,,2011-07-14,2018-04-26,,,,ARCHIVAL MATERIAL DOES NOT CIRCULATE.,IFPRI1,FCND,,,,,FCND DP89,English,,861350507,,Non-PR,2 pages,"Washington, D.C.",,International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),,Brief,Discussion paper http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/125444,mailto:ifpri-library@cgiar.org,,FCND Discussion paper brief,89,,,,"small enterprises

1303,"The role of school quality in determining educational outcomes has received much research attention in the United States. However, in developing countries, where a significant part of the school age population never attends school, policymakers must consider both quality and quantity when deciding how to maximize the impact of scarce investments. Acknowledging this difference in the policy environment in developing countries, this paper provides comparative estimates of the impact of quality versus quantity investments in school supply in rural Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries. Policy simulations show that improving school quality (through the pupil-teacher ratio) increases grade attainment and efficiency by approximately 9 percent with no impact on overall enrollment rates. However, these same results can be generated by increasing starting enrollment probabilities through the establishment of new schools in all rural villages that currently do not have schools. Furthermore, similar rates of increase in school achievement indicators can be achieved by building schools in only 56 percent of all villages currently without schools, provided these schools are placed in those villages that also do not have a school nearby. When cost information is considered, the main policy implication is that the expansion of school quantity through well targeted placement of new schools will provide the greatest increase in educational outcomes for Mozambique at this time.",Open Access,,"Handa, Sudhanshu

The survey that was conducted in 1997 made extensive use of long-term recall questions ascertaining changes during the past 10 years in rice yields, wages, population, soil fertility, and other pertinent variables of rural development. We find that—on average for all villages—the yields of irrigated rice, the major food crop, and real agricultural wages declined, while the communities expanded their upland area by nearly a quarter and experienced deteriorating fertility of their upland soils. These patterns are consistent with the wide-held belief that rural areas in Madagascar have witnessed increased poverty,   economic stagnation, and a continued degradation of the natural resources. Yet, the five agroecological regions in our sample exhibit quite different patterns of rural development, and at least one of them has experienced increases in yields and wages. From a policy perspective, it is important to better understand the driving forces of such   diverse rural change. The overall decline in rural wages over the past 10 years is expected to have contributed to increased poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition in rural areas, as rural wage laborers traditionally belong to the poorest of the poor in Madagascar. In this   paper, we present an econometric analysis of the determinants of and interdependencies between the three components of sustainable development: economic growth, environmental sustainability, and poverty alleviation.",Open Access,,"Zeller, Manfred

It compares information obtained using participatory appraisal techniques with a survey of households randomly drawn from a locally administered census that had been carefully revised. The community map tends to include household members who do not, in fact, reside in the enumerated locality. By contrast, the revised official census is slightly more likely to exclude household members who actually lived in the surveyed area. Controlling for the survey technique, we find that the revised official census produces higher estimates of average household size and wealth but lower estimates of total village size or wealth, than the community map. Pairwise comparison of the survey techniques, holding the households constant, shows that the community map leads, on average, to higher estimates of household size and lower estimates of wealth.",Open Access,,"Christiaensen, Luc

Using household-level panel data collected in 1982 and 1997, the study finds that household collection time significantly increases with measures of environmental resource scarcity, and that the increase appears to come almost equally from men and women. Additionally, the results of this study indicate that household collection burdens are significantly lower in 1997 than in 1982, and that women have seen the largest decrease in their time spent collecting. The picture is not an entirely rosy one, however, as consumption of environmental goods is also significantly lower in 1997 compared to 1982. The results taken together indicate that one should not hastily attribute decreases in collection labor burdens to successful forest rehabilitation in areas managed by forest user groups. In this case it appears that lower collection times are principally due to reduced consumption and increased collection from private land.",Open Access,,"Cooke, Priscilla A.",,43359.pdf,47901,,,,,,2011-07-14,2022-08-26,,,,,"IFPRI1

In contrast to the unitary model, the collective model posits that individuals within households have different preferences and do not pool their income. Moreover, the collective model predicts that intrahousehold allocations reflect   differences in preferences and ""bargaining power"" of individuals within the household. Using new household data sets from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and South Africa, we present measures of individual characteristics that are highly correlated with bargaining power, namely human capital and in ividually-controlled assets, evaluated at the time of marriage. In all country case studies we reject the unitary model as a description of household behavior, but to different degrees. Results suggest that assets controlled by women have a positive and significant effect on expenditure allocations toward the next generation, such as education and children's clothing. We also examine individual-level education outcomes and find that parents do not have identical preferences toward sons and daughters within or across countries.",Open Access,,"Quisumbing, Agnes R.

These surveys, along with ENCASEH 1997, provide a valuable source of information on household and community level characteristics before and after the implementation of the program. Other reports in the evaluation series have focused on the direct effects of  PROGRESA, using the control and treatment groups in the ENCELS. The objective of this report is slightly different, in that it explores the possible spill-over effects of the program on the wider community. Hence instead of focusing on program effects at the individual level, we focus on aggregate community level indicators of well-being such as poverty, inequality, and school and health care attendance rates, in order to assess the impact of PROGRESA at this level. Using the data sets mentioned above, we develop five indicators with which to measure the potential impact of PROGRESA at the community level. These indicators are: 1) changes in rates of relative poverty, 2) changes in inequality, 3) school continuation rates, 4) changes in nutrition surveillance rates, 5) changes in prices (inflation). Exploiting the longitudinal aspect of the evaluation data, we construct ""difference in differences"" estimators and use regression techniques to isolate community level program effects.",Open Access,,"Handa, Sudhanshu

1315,"The objective of this report is to conduct a re-evaluation of the targeting methods used by PROGRESA in light of the revisions adopted by the PROGRESA administration regarding how    households are selected as eligible for PROGRESA benefits. Soon after completion of the report by Skoufias, Davis and Behrman in June 1999 we were informed that PROGRESA had added new households to the list of beneficiaries through a process called densification"" since it was felt that the original selection method was biased against the elderly poor who no longer lived with their children. As a result of the “densification” process the percent of households classified as eligible for program benefits increased from 52% of the sample to 78% of the sample. Given this large expansion in the number of eligible households it was felt that it is imperative to re-evaluate the targeting methods used by PROGRESA by adopting the same approach and methods used in the June 1999 report. Under the circumstances the June 1999 report should be considered as more relevant for providing detailed information about the methods used to evaluate PROGRESA’a targeting whereas this report should be considered as containing the definitive results of the evaluation of PROGRESA’s targeting methods. PROGRESA’s methodology consists of three stages: (1) the selection of localities; (2) the selection of beneficiary households within selected localities, and (3) finalizing the list of beneficiaries after feedback from the community assemblies about families excluded or included incorrectly. We evaluate in detail the first two stages of the selection process. We do not provide an evaluation of the third stage of selection as the number of households whose selection into PROGRESA was disputed at this stage of the selection process was minute (0.1% of the total number of selected households). Our evaluation is based on a framework consisting of three key elements: (i) a social objective, (ii) a set of economic, political and social constraints under which policy has to operate, and (iii) a range of instruments available to attain these objectives. Although PROGRESA has a number of interlinked objectives with respect to health, education and nutrition, we will measure the benefits of PROGRESA’s targeting solely in terms of its potential impact on poverty alleviation.""",Open Access,,"Skoufias, Emmanuel

1320,"Many developing countries have achieved impressive growth rates in agriculture in recent decades....[but] hunger and malnutrition persist in many countries, often because past patterns of agricultural growth were insufficient or failed to adequately benefit the poor. These patterns have sometimes harmed the environment and exacerbated poverty and food insecurity among rural people, even as agriculture has met national food needs and contributed to export earnings. But poverty and environmental degradation are not an inevitable outcome of agricultural growth. Rather, these negative effects reflect inappropriate economic incentives for managing modern inputs in intensive farming systems, insufficient investment in many heavily populated backward areas, inadequate social and poverty concerns, and political systems that are often biased against rural people. With appropriate government policies and investments, institutional development, and agricultural research, there is no reason why agricultural development cannot simultaneously contribute to growth, poverty alleviation, and environmental sustainability.",Open Access,,"Hazell, P.

Given this large expansion in the number of eligible households it was felt that it is imperative to re-evaluate the targeting methods used by PROGRESA by adopting the same approach and methods used in the June 1999 report. Under the circumstances the June 1999 report should be considered as more relevant for providing detailed information about the methods used to evaluate PROGRESA’a targeting whereas this report should be considered as containing the definitive results of the evaluation of PROGRESA’s targeting methods. PROGRESA’s methodology consists of three stages: (1) the selection of localities; (2) the selection of beneficiary households within selected localities, and (3) finalizing the list of beneficiaries after feedback from the community assemblies about families excluded or included incorrectly. We evaluate in detail the first two stages of the selection process. We do not provide an evaluation of the third stage of selection as the number of households whose selection into PROGRESA was disputed at this stage of the selection process was minute (0.1% of the total number of selected households). Our evaluation is based on a framework consisting of three key elements: (i) a social objective, (ii) a set of economic, political and social constraints under which policy has to operate, and (iii) a range of instruments available to attain these objectives. Although PROGRESA has a number of interlinked objectives with respect to health, education and nutrition, we will measure the benefits of PROGRESA’s targeting solely in terms of its potential impact on poverty alleviation.""",Open Access,,"Skoufias, Emmanuel

However this demand is met, population and farming pressure on land resources will intensify greatly. There is growing concern in some quarters that a decline in long-term soil productivity is already seriously limiting food production in the developing world, and that the problem is getting worse.

1341,"This study attempts to identify the impacts of land tenure institutions on the efficiency of  farm management based on a case study of paddy rice and upland cinnamon production in the Kerinci Valley in West Sumatra, where most of Indonesia’s  cinnamon is produced. The attractiveness of cinnamon as a commercial crop has implications for forest preservation. Kerinci Valley is an enclave surrounded by the Kerinci Seblat National Park, one of the largest parks in Sumatra. The highest plant biodiversity richness measured to date anywhere in the world recently was recorded in areas surrounding this park. Expansion of cinnamon area by clearing forest land therefore occurs at the expense of forest conservation.The brief concludes that, in sum, the evolution of customary tenure institutions and factor markets seems effective in achieving a financially efficient allocation of resources in the short run and accumulation of investments in agroforestry trees over time. At present, property rights in land (and trees) are well recognized and respected among community members, so that there does not seem to be much room for improving investment incentives by strengthening individual rights within these indigenous societies. However, in the long run, a land titling program may be necessary to further enhance management efficiency.",Open Access,,"Suyanto, S.

This brief sets forth policy implications: Preference for sons in the inheritance of agroforestry area in the Low Region may be explained by the intensive use of male labor in rubber production; in contrast, both paddy cultivation and cinnamon cultivation in the Middle Region use both male and female family labor relatively equally. The inheritance system seems to be evolving from a strictly matrilineal system to a more egalitarian system in which sons and daughters inherit the type of land which is more intensive in their own work effort. That is, the newly-emerging customary land tenure institutions, by allowing for inheritance consistent with comparative advantage and work effort, seem to have built-in incentives for men and women. The persistent gender gap in schooling, however, needs to be addressed. Even if daughters continue to have independent land rights, lower levels of education make them less likely to benefit from nonagricultural income earning opportunities...Investing in the education of both sons and daughters would thus be part of a long-term solution to rural poverty and environmental sustainability in these areas.",Open Access,,"Quisumbing, Agnes R.

They draw attention to the lack of adequate information on the magnitude and impact of pest losses; with out such information, policy makers are handicapped when devising strategies for meeting food needs. The authors address both chemical and nonchemical approaches to pest management, high lighting the importance of biotechnology. There is growing public sentiment against biotechnology but little appreciation as yet of its contributions to alleviating hunger by, among other things, controlling pest losses. The authors also adress the important subject of the roles of different actors in pest management, most notably the private sector. A world with out pests is unrealistic and probably undesirable. However, a world with severely reduced losses of food production to pests is achievable by 2020. This paper shows us how.",Open Access,,"Yudelman, Montague

Communal land tenure institutions aim to achieve and preserve the equitable distribution of land (and hence, income) among community members. Uncultivated forestland is owned by the community or village, and as long as forest land is available, forest clearance of forest is easily approved by the village chief. Forest clearance is usually rewarded by relatively strong individual rights to land, which are further strengthened by long-term or permanent improvements in the land. Land rights, however, tend to become weaker if land is put into fallow over extended periods. In communal ownership systems, individual rights to transfer and inheritance are limited and controlled by leaders of the extended family. Thus, incentives to invest in land resources under such land tenure rules may be weaker due to unclear and uncertain individual rights....Changes in mode of land acquisition. Based on a survey of  60 villages in Western Ghana, where cocoa is the dominant crop, this study identifies statistically the determinants and the consequences of changing customary land tenure institutions....Under increasing population pressure, shifting cultivation becomes unsustainable since gradual decreases in the fallow period reduce soil fertility. Under such conditions, more labor-intensive and land-saving farming systems must be established. In Western Ghana, customary land tenure institutions have evolved toward individualized systems in order to provide appropriate incentives to invest in tree planting and  management.",Open Access,,"Otsuka, Keijiro

Inherited and temporarily allocated family lands are being transferred to wives and children as inter-vivos gifts, to be planted with cocoa.  Giving gifts is a way to circumvent the traditional Akan matrilineal land inheritance system in which land is transferred from a deceased man to his matrilineal relatives but not to his wife and children. This study examines the effects of this process of individualization on the production efficiency of cocoa and food crops using detailed household-level data from 249 households in 10 villages in Western Ghana.....Given that a major proportion of labor input into young cocoa cultivation is provided by women and children, it is not surprising that gift transactions have evolved to increase their incentive to provide labor in establishing cocoa. There are also no significant gender differences in either net revenue per hectare or labor use per hectare.

After years of structural biases and general disinterest in the developing world’s agricultural sector, global trade is now forcing poorer, agrarian-based economies to assess their natural comparative advantages and quickly adapt. Almost revolutionary structures, policies, and strategies are now required to meet such challenges. While the view taken here emphasizes that the changes under way offer considerable opportunities, it also recognizes that many producers and rural residents lack the relevant experiences, skills, and financial support to adjust to the new conditions. To make the decisive shift toward markets, national governments must become convinced that fundamental structural changes are in their national interests. Accepting this will not always be easy, and in that regard donors will need to play more aggressive and vigilant roles. Producers, the private sector and agribusiness investors, NGOs, and universities in developed and developing countries will also have to play mutually beneficial roles.

In communal ownership systems, individual rights to transfer and inheritance are limited and controlled by leaders of the extended family. Thus, incentives to invest in land resources under such land tenure rules may be weaker due to unclear and uncertain individual rights....Changes in mode of land acquisition. Based on a survey of  60 villages in Western Ghana, where cocoa is the dominant crop, this study identifies statistically the determinants and the consequences of changing customary land tenure institutions....Under increasing population pressure, shifting cultivation becomes unsustainable since gradual decreases in the fallow period reduce soil fertility. Under such conditions, more labor-intensive and land-saving farming systems must be established. In Western Ghana, customary land tenure institutions have evolved toward individualized systems in order to provide appropriate incentives to invest in tree planting and  management.",Open Access,,"Otsuka, Keijiro

Inherited and temporarily allocated family lands are being transferred to wives and children as inter-vivos gifts, to be planted with cocoa.  Giving gifts is a way to circumvent the traditional Akan matrilineal land inheritance system in which land is transferred from a deceased man to his matrilineal relatives but not to his wife and children. This study examines the effects of this process of individualization on the production efficiency of cocoa and food crops using detailed household-level data from 249 households in 10 villages in Western Ghana.....Given that a major proportion of labor input into young cocoa cultivation is provided by women and children, it is not surprising that gift transactions have evolved to increase their incentive to provide labor in establishing cocoa. There are also no significant gender differences in either net revenue per hectare or labor use per hectare. Thus, the transfer of land to women through gifts has improved gender equity without sacrificing production efficiency.",Open Access,,"Otsuka, Keijiro

These changes have already affected the livelihoods of millions of the region’s inhabitants and promise to reshape the region’s food and agricultural system well into the 21st century. How will these changes help the countries of the region confront the challenges to achieving the 2020 Vision for Latin America, a vision of a world where wealth is fairly distributed; where there is no hunger, extreme poverty, or malnutrition; and where resource use benefits the generations of tomorrow as well as the people of today?

This brief sets forth policy implications: Preference for sons in the inheritance of agroforestry area in the Low Region may be explained by the intensive use of male labor in rubber production; in contrast, both paddy cultivation and cinnamon cultivation in the Middle Region use both male and female family labor relatively equally. The inheritance system seems to be evolving from a strictly matrilineal system to a more egalitarian system in which sons and daughters inherit the type of land which is more intensive in their own work effort. That is, the newly-emerging customary land tenure institutions, by allowing for inheritance consistent with comparative advantage and work effort, seem to have built-in incentives for men and women. The persistent gender gap in schooling, however, needs to be addressed. Even if daughters continue to have independent land rights, lower levels of education make them less likely to benefit from nonagricultural income earning opportunities...Investing in the education of both sons and daughters would thus be part of a long-term solution to rural poverty and environmental sustainability in these areas.",Open Access,,"Quisumbing, Agnes R.

The scale of the disease is so large that it now raises questions about the impact of AIDS on the future development path of many of the world’s poorest developing countries. Through its effects on population levels and growth rates and on macroeconomic growth, AIDS may influence the prospects for achieving food security in the developing world by the year 2020. AIDS is most prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS imposes both direct and indirect costs on its, as on all, national economies. AIDS is particularly devastating to economic growth because the disease strikes adults in their most productive years. Furthermore, in the early years the epidemic seemed to spread fastest among people with above-average education and skills, further sharpening the economic impact. HIV/AIDS is intimately connected to food security in a cyclical relationship. The consequences of food insecurity, specifically inadequate intake of calories and nutrients, render individuals more susceptible to HIV infection and cause them to progress faster from HIV infection to AIDS and, ultimately, to death. HIV/AIDS, in turn, hinders countries’ ability to achieve national food security through its effects on population and economic growth. For most of the African economies considered in this study, population growth rates are unlikely to fall below 2 percent by 2020, unless the onslaught of AIDS continues unchecked.

1363,"Russia's food economy is undergoing a fundamental transition. Rapid changes and adjustments are still taking place in the market and pricing systems, in the subsidies to output and input markets and the credit market, and in the process of privatization and other structural reforms. These transformations have far-reaching effects on domestic supply and demand relationships. And, as part of the still greater economic changes taking place in the former planned economies of central and eastern Europe, these transformations may have extensive ramifications for international food markets. The authors describe agricultural policy before reform and then the state of reforms and agriculture today. They then turn to future food consumption and production trends. The authors conclude that Russian agriculture will remain in transition for a long time. Risky labor and food markets and the inaccessibility of financing are causing the expansion of small-scale farming and the home production of food. Managerial deficiencies and market imperfections are hindering a revitalization of large-scale farming. Certainly the potential for major production increases exists in Russia, as well as in some other countries of the former Soviet Union, especially Ukraine and Kazakhstan. One need not be overly optimistic to assume that efficiency will improve and this potential will be realized over the long term. During the period covered by the projections given here, however, institutional constraints, friction in finance, land, and labor markets, and limited infrastructure will probably prevent farmers and the food-processing sector from responding strongly to incentives and will continue to inhibit the efficiency and growth of the Russian food economy.",Open Access,,"von Braun, Joachim

One of these is the successful use of new biotechnologies in agriculture. Research in recombinant genetics and biotechnology aims to develop plant varieties that provide reliable high yields at the same or lower costs by breeding in qualities such as resistance to disease, pests, and stress factors such as aridity. Realization of these goals could lead to tremendous gains in food production. However, biotechnology is now evoking the same objections that have been raised against the Green Revolution--that its benefits are distributed inequitably in favor of the large, rich farmers and that it is potentially environmentally destructive. In this brief, Leisinger discusses the need for biotechnology  and its sociopolitical ramifications and he looks at the roles played by the public and private sectors. In conclusion, the author states that biotechnology offers no silver bullet for food security -- there are no silver bullets--but biotechnology is an important instrument in the difficult fight against hunger.

Governments and donors should look more closely at the benefits of investing in the agriculture of less-favored areas. Even without including social and environmental benefits, the line can already be redrawn on what is economically justified.

1373,"Russia's food economy is undergoing a fundamental transition. Rapid changes and adjustments are still taking place in the market and pricing systems, in the subsidies to output and input markets and the credit market, and in the process of privatization and other structural reforms. These transformations have far-reaching effects on domestic supply and demand relationships. And, as part of the still greater economic changes taking place in the former planned economies of central and eastern Europe, these transformations may have extensive ramifications for international food markets. The authors describe agricultural policy before reform and then the state of reforms and agriculture today. They then turn to future food consumption and production trends. The authors conclude that Russian agriculture will remain in transition for a long time. Risky labor and food markets and the inaccessibility of financing are causing the expansion of small-scale farming and the home production of food. Managerial deficiencies and market imperfections are hindering a revitalization of large-scale farming. Certainly the potential for major production increases exists in Russia, as well as in some other countries of the former Soviet Union, especially Ukraine and Kazakhstan. One need not be overly optimistic to assume that efficiency will improve and this potential will be realized over the long term. During the period covered by the projections given here, however, institutional constraints, friction in finance, land, and labor markets, and limited infrastructure will probably prevent farmers and the food-processing sector from responding strongly to incentives and will continue to inhibit the efficiency and growth of the Russian food economy.",Open Access,,"von Braun, Joachim

1374,"After seven years of arduous negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations was concluded in late 1993. The United States approved the agreement in late 1994, in time for the 1995 commencement of the new World Trade Organization (WTO), which will implement the agreement and provide the major forum for future trade negotiations.  There have been a number of quantitative studies of the impact of world trade liberalization and of the formation of subregional free trade areas such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mercosur in South America, and the new Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Most of these studies focus on the impact of changes in policy, analyzing the efficiency gains and structural changes that might be induced by changes in import protection. The goal of such studies is not to project the future but to analyze the empirical mechanisms by which policy changes affect the world economy.  In this brief, the authors discuss studies of world trade liberalization  and studies of regional trading areas. Finally, they state that recent quantitative studies generally find that global trade liberalization yields substantially larger economic benefits, including benefits to agriculture, than the proliferation of regional trading arrangements. Thus, while increasing regionalism is emerging as an important element of the current international political economy, it is not a desirable outcome in itself.",Open Access,,"Robinson, Sherman

Global food supplies have for many years been more than  adequate to feed the world's population. Nonetheless, hunger and malnutrition are still painful realities. Does hunger represent a failure of states to serve their populations? Would the situation be different if food was a legal right of every individual in the world? The international community has for decades struggled over creating a right to food for the individual, and over defining it in legally enforceable terms. Although they continue to endorse the right to food, states have not translated this right into specific legal obligations, nor are there any effective national or international mechanisms to supervise the implementation of this right. 2020 Vision research indicates that although the global food supply may continue to be sufficient to feed the world to the year 2020, the incidence of malnutrition and food insecurity will remain high unless current national and international policies and priorities are changed. Perhaps this then is a time for the international community to examine its fundamental objective in development.

1384,"Global food production, so far, has increased continuously because cropped area has expanded and productivity per unit area has increased. In some regions of the world, however, there is little scope for further spatial expansion of agriculture. In other areas, crop yields are stagnating. Does this imply that the world is approaching the biophysical limits of food production? In this research nine food-demand scenarios were analyzed, ranging from minimum population growth combined with a vegetarian diet to maximum population growth combined with an affluent diet containing an ample amount of animal products. With an environment-oriented agriculture, all regions can produce the food required even for an affluent diet, except for East, South, and Southeast Asia; the three regions with the least leeway will carry almost half of the global population. West Asia and West and North Africa come close to the lower limit. A much less expensive diet provides the only option for escape, apart from massive food imports. Europe, the former U.S.S.R., North America, Oceania, South America, and Central Africa are well-off and need only part of their suitable land to feed their populations whatever their diet. However, if trade can distribute food efficiently across the globe, all people may consume an affluent diet, but at the expense of intensive use of two-thirds of the globe for arable crops and rangeland.",Open Access,,"Penning de Vries, Frits W.

Water is abundant globally but scarce locally. Countries are considered water scarce when annual internal renewable water resources are less than 1,000 cubic meters per capita per year. Below this threshold, water availability is considered a severe constraint on socioeconomic development and environmental quality. Currently, some 30 countries are considered water stressed, of which 20 are absolutely water scarce. By 2020, the number of water scarce countries will likely approach 35. Equally worrisome, virtually all developing countries, even those with adequate water in the aggregate, suffer from debilitating seasonal and regional shortages that urgently need to be addressed. Cooperation between countries sharing the same water basin will become increasingly important as water becomes scarcer. Reconciliation is cheaper than armed conflict. A key to defusing potential international conflicts over water is national water policy reform to ensure the most efficient use of available water supplies. Countries must therefore begin the painful process of reforming national water policies and treating water as a scarce resource.",Open Access,,"Rosegrant, Mark W.",,125891.pdf,125860,,,,,,2011-12-20,2015-10-28,,,,,"IFPRI1

1386,"Meeting world food needs in the year 2020 will depend even more than it does now on the capabilities and resources of women. Women are responsible for generating food security for their families in many developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Women not only process, purchase, and prepare food, but they also play a significant role in national agricultural production, producing both food and cash crops. Population growth, urbanization, and the limited potential for increasing production through the expansion of cultivated area imply that, for food needs to be met in the future, yields will have to increase. Agricultural research continues to develop new varieties with higher yields and increased tolerance to unfavorable environmental conditions, but an untapped source of productivity gains could lie in addressing gender disparities in agriculture. This brief examines the key roles that women play in maintaining the three pillars of food security--food production, food access, and food utilization--and it looks at how strengthening these pillars through policies that enhance women's abilities and resources provides a solution to meeting world food needs in the year 2020.",Open Access,,"Brown, Lynn R.

This concern arises because agricultural investments are declining and donors are paying scant attention to agriculture in their development strategies. Is the neglect of agriculture a one-way trend or is it a cyclical issue? Or is it simply a symptom that can be quickly remedied by new policy orientations? An important step in examining this issue is to identify phases in the macroeconomic and political thinking that have guided the actions of those concerned with developing countries since the 1950s. By the year 2020, an additional 2.8 billion people will have to be nourished. Since the potential for land expansion is limited, the necessary food production increases will have to be generated by productivity increases and technical progress.

1389,"In agrarian developing countries the natural environment is a key determinant of both poverty and nutritional status. Climate, terrain, and soil characteristics drive the agricultural system, determining in large part cropping patterns, choice of crops, yield rates, and overall productivity levels. The human resources crucial to agricultural productivity are also influenced by the natural environment. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is placing priority on developing a concept of ecoregional zones based on the premise that agroecological conditions largely determine the production potential and the size of population that an area can support in the developing world. Understanding the ecoregional dimensions of poverty and malnutrition potentially could be a major step forward in alleviating poverty sustainably by the year 2020 because it may help to target scarce resources more effectively. There are clearly discernible links between the natural environment, agricultural productivity, health, and nutritional status. Use of an ecoregional dimension to explore the incidence of malnutrition exploits these linkages. Analysis at the ecoregional level suggests that targeting of scarce resources to address the problems of poverty and malnutrition could potentially be improved by 2020 by taking into consideration these linkages between ecoregional characteristics and poverty.",Open Access,,"Sharma, Manohar

While agriculture is critical to the long-term solution of sustainable livelihood and food security in the humid tropics, it is only part of the story. To take pressure off land, nonagricultural sectors of rural economies must be strengthened in addition to improving agricultural productivity. In short, what is called for is a portfolio of agricultural, extractive, and nonagricultural activities that involve technological innovation designed for higher productivity of land and labor. These activities must translate into higher profitability for the farmer at lower cost to the environment and must be compatible with the constrained resource position of the small farmer.",Open Access,,"Vosti, Stephen A.",,130815.pdf,130604,,,,,,2016-08-30,2016-08-30,,,,,"IFPRI1

1394,"A primary focus of the IFPRI 2020 Vision initiative is to find ways for people to attain food security, that is, sufficient food to lead healthy and productive lives. But what is sufficient? And is providing access to food the primary means of protecting people (particularly women and children) against malnutrition, which now faces millions of people around the world? Recent evidence indicates that improvements in household food security, as measured by adequate calories, do not necessarily translate into improvements in the nutritional status of women and children. One reason for persistent malnutrition may lie in the complex interaction between food supply and illness, which is influenced by the overall health environment. This is often called the ""leaking bucket effect,"" wherein improvements in access to the foods that are important for good nutritional status may be offset by poor access to nonfood inputs, such as quality health care facilities and services, education, sanitation, and clean water or ineffective mechanisms for delivering these services. If this is so, greater emphasis should be placed on improving access to these nonfood inputs in order to achieve the 2020 Vision.

1396,"Achieving food security has been the overriding goal of agricultural policy in India. The introduction and rapid spread of high-yielding rice and wheat varieties in the late 1960s and early 1970s resulted in steady output growth for foodgrains. Public investment in irrigation and other rural infrastructure and research and extension, together with improved crop production practices, has significantly helped to expand production and stocks of foodgrains. However, concern is increasing that the rapid growth from the Green Revolution is waning. Public investments in agriculture are declining, and the annual increment to gross capital formation in agriculture is now lower than in the early 1980s. In the years to come, higher economic growth as well as sizable population growth will increase the demand for food. The structure of demand is also changing, as diets are diversifying from the basic cereal staples to fruits, vegetables, and other higher-valued foods. Collaborative research between the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has explored how these possibly conflicting trends in supply and demand will affect net trade in grains in India, and it suggests policies for meeting the growing demand.",Open Access,,"Kumar, Praduman

1398,"Poverty is a significant and persistent problem in developing countries. Over 1.1 billion people live in households that earn a dollar a day or less per person. Almost half of the population of South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa lives in absolute poverty; only East Asia has managed to substantially reduce the proportion of its population that is absolutely poor. Agricultural growth stimulates economic growth in nonagricultural sectors, which, in turn, results in increased employment and reduced poverty. This further stimulates demand for agricultural goods, acting as a growth multiplier in the agricultural sector. The limited availability of new land, however, means that agricultural intensification -- increasing the productivity of land already under cultivation--is the key to alleviating poverty through an agricultural growth strategy. Thus addressing rural poverty in the first instance is a crucial catalyst in igniting agriculture as an engine of growth in an economy. The authors conclude with a set of recommendations that, while addressing poverty in its most immediate form, promotes sustained poverty alleviation and economic growth.",Open Access,,"Brown, Lynn R.

Increase in incomes and reduction in poverty are important, but experiences in several countries indicate that even where there is no rapid improvement in incomes, malnutrition can be reduced by explicit programs and policies that aim at improving household access to food and health services and improving child care practices such as breastfeeding and proper weaning of infants.

Roughly 700 million people in developing countries do not have access to sufficient food supplies to meet their needs for a healthy and productive life. Already because of population growth, the developing world is being asked to feed 88 million additional people every year. How can this production task be met if environmentally destructive farming practices continue?  Paarlberg examines the geography  and the politics of resource abuse. He concludes that the sustainable farming debate will remain deadlocked until it is recast in a region-specific and politically aware form that emphasizes the vastly different circumstances of farmers in different parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. If regional precision is maintained, paralyzing technical arguments between powerful agriculturalists and environmentalists can be minimized, and important reform imperatives that go beyond technical choice can be highlighted as well.",Open Access,,"Paarlberg, Robert L.",,136820.pdf,136609,,,,,1994-07-01,2023-03-10,2023-03-10,,"Paarlberg, Robert L. 1994.

However, economic performance has been uneven across developing regions and countries. Poverty is a major consequence of deteriorating or slow economic growth. In 1991, 51.6 percent of the world's population was living in 30 countries that had GNP per capita of less than US$500. World Bank estimates of poverty in the developing world suggest that in 1985, an estimated 1 billion people were poor: they lived below a poverty line of about $420 per person per year. South Asia was home to about half of the developing world's poor,  but projections suggest that Sub-Saharan Africa will increasingly become a locus of poverty in coming years as the number of poor people in that region increases from about 184 million in 1985 to 304 million people in 2000. The magnitude of poverty is also anticipated to increase in Latin America and the Caribbean and in the Middle East and North Africa between now and 2000, but to decline by more than half in East Asia from 182 million in 1985 to 73 million in 2000. Overall, the absolute number of poor people in all developing countries is expected to increase slightly, but their share of the total population will decline from 31 percent in 1985 to 24 percent in 2000 due to population growth.",Open Access,,"Pandya-Lorch, Rajul",,130811.pdf,130600,,,,,,2016-08-30,2016-08-30,,,,,"IFPRI1
